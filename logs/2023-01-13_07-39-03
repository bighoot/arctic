    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

[35mThe Halls of Myth[0;37m
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

lies to the west, beyond which the Crystalmir Lake can be seen. To the east
this dirt trail merges with a wide road.

dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

to the north and east. The terrain to the east becomes dry and dusty,
while you can see what appears to be a forest on the edge of the plains to
the north.

    A raised road leads across the bog to the south and to the west. The
road has been built up with various materials to accommodate the travellers
of this region. The bog can be seen in all directions from here, the only

foothills slowly growing smaller and fading into the flat plains of
Dergoth. The eastern arm of the Kharolis mountains can be seen far off to

    This large road, composed mostly of dry, dusty dirt, winds its way
across the parched yellow grasses of the plains towards Delphon to the
west, and to a crossroad east of here. The wind carries with it the sounds
of Delphon, a large city whose towering black gates glitter in both
darkness and light. Many travelers pass you by, most heading west towards
the great city of Delphon or beginning the trek to Port Balifor which rests
southeast of here, along the shores of the Khurman Sea. The breeze dies
down a bit, replaced with the cawing of vultures overhead.

this road is flanked to both the north and the south. Far to the southeast

    Cowering in the shadows of the black city walls, this cobbled path is
almost completely lost in shadow. The roughly hewn cobbles are covered with
filth and trash, and the path probably hasn't been cleaned in months. More
care has been taken in hewing the stones used to make the massive walls,
clearly showing where the city's priorities lie. A dreary gloom hangs over
the area, and it would be unwise to linger here longer than necessary. The
dismal cobblestone path continues to the east and west from here, and there
is a large clearing hewn out of the forest north of the dark city.

[36mThe Main Gates of Neraka[0;37m
    The ominous black stones of the city walls press in close, creating a
killing zone in front of the terrifying main gates of Neraka. The gates are
forged from solid steel and adorned with stylized golden sculptures of the
Dark Queen -- as the warrior and as the seductress. The massive gates stand
guard beneath a foreboding archway, and a life-like stone sculpture of the
five-headed dragon perches protectively over the gates. The dragon's heads
seem to be moving, but that is probably just a trick of the shadows.

    Opulent black and gold pennants hang from the stone walls surrounding
this ominous courtyard. A golden throne sits upon a dais at the eastern end
of the courtyard, and there is enough space for a couple hundred troops to
line up before it. The ostentatious decorations have clearly been designed
to instill visitors with a sense of awe, but everything looks a bit small,
as if the architect was told to exercise moderation and didn't know how. A
pair of cruel black gates stand at the northern end of the courtyard, while
a spacious stone passageway leads off to the south. Beyond the west end of
the courtyard lies a broad lane and the dolorous milieu of the dark city.

[36mA Dimly Lit Chapel[0;37m
    Set apart from the main temple, the crumbling stone walls of this dark
chapel seem to absorb any stray sound. In this deathly quiet sanctuary,
the Dark Queen's most devout clerics come to commune with their goddess,
free of any disturbances from the outside world. The small black shrine at
the north end of the dark chapel glows with an unholy light that makes the
stone walls appear to phase in and out of existence. The rest of the black
temple lies to the south, beyond a narrow archway flanked by gargoyles.

Hailing from the once-lush forest of Silvanesti, the delicate features of
this pale elf cause him to stand out from the ugly masses that make up most
of the Dark Queen's faithful. His delicate blonde hair always seems to be
blowing dreamily in an imagined breeze, but his icy blue eyes glitter with
loathing and cruelty. Yet it is said that he will share his sagely wisdom
with young disciples of Takhisis who come to beg for counsel and teaching.

[36mThe Queen's Court[0;37m
    This vast, open courtyard is large enough to hold thousands of people
and is an excellent place for the dark pilgrims to gather an audience for
mass prayers or public executions. The west end of the court is dominated
by a raised platform where such spectacles can be staged in full view of
the citizenry, and a five-headed dragon has been carved on the wall behind
it. This courtyard somehow manages to be both magnificent and terrible at
the same time. Twisted black gates stand guard to the south while a
spacious stone passageway lies to the north. A wide lane begins at the base
of the platform and leads east into the dismal melee of the city.

    The central area of this large chamber is filled with lounge chairs
and sofas, looted from many different parts of the world. Each appears to
be more inviting than the last. Tall midnight blue partitions separate the
central lounge from the intimate areas near the shadowy edges of the vast
chamber. Heavy drapes of crushed black velvet hang upon the walls, but the
drapes do little to muffle the moaning sounds that hang in the air.

[36mA Cobbled Path[0;37m
    Cowering in the shadows of the black city walls, this cobbled path is
almost completely lost in shadow. The roughly hewn cobbles are covered with
filth and trash, and the path probably hasn't been cleaned in months. More
care has been taken in hewing the stones used to make the massive walls,
clearly showing where the city's priorities lie. A dreary gloom hangs over
the area, and it would be unwise to linger here longer than necessary. The
dismal cobblestone path continues to the east and west from here, and there
is a midnight blue curtain hanging across an opening in the stone wall.

provides heat and a tapped keg fuels some levity. Poorly placed canvas
hardly covers the wooden construction of the tent and wind whistles through
open joints. A small adjoining log structure to the west serves as the
kitchen while cots line both sides of the lengthy, semi-private passage to
the south. The main road through the camp is to the east.

door adorned with a painting of a terrifying black dragon dominates the
northern wall, marking the entrance to an office that appears to have some

    A massive stone fireplace takes up the southern wall of the kitchen
which has been built large enough to allow the resident chef to cook for
large numbers of recruits at once. Dangling from the ceiling near the
eastern wall are steel chains with large hooks on them, ready to hang fresh
venison so it can be cleaned prior to cooking. The stone floor is mostly
clean, though the area underneath the dangling chains has been stained
crimson with animal blood. Dominating the center of the room is a large oak
cutting table which is covered with various cooking utensils.

    This meekly adorned room is lined with rows of wooden bunk beds, each
of which has a steel footlocker beside it to allow trainees to store their
valuables. The beds are neatly made, each in the same manner, with blankets
perfectly folded. The walls are lined with wrought iron torches in a
similar style to the rest of the compound. An opening in the western wall
leads to a small latrine while the barracks continues to the east.

alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on
the Blood Sea northeast of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

you descend into the hole, stepping onto a ladder below and into an

    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the
tunnel continues into darkness.

source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

fatigued from long hours of training in the lower floors. Lumpy bunks
covered in wiry grey sheets stand stacked closed together, almost rising up
to the ceiling. Small footlockers are wedged underneath the bottom bunks,
containing the recruits' only worldly possessions. The line of cots runs

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a neighboring

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
