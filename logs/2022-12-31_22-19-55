paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off to
the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.

    The mighty Vingaard river rushes past you as it rushes through the
plains to the south. There is a heavy scent of saltwater to the air, marking
the estuary of the river to the northeast. The river is thinner here, banks
herding the river on its course. On each of the north and south sides of
the rivers, roads lead through the lands towards Palanthas and the Lord
City of Kalaman.

    You are standing on the northern banks of the Vingaard river. The
roaring river flows past you, splashing water near your feet. The river
appears to be too fast and wide for you to cross safely by yourself. As you
survey the river banks around you, you notice a ferry not far from you.
Perhaps you can get a ride across the river on it. Leading away from the
river there is a path heading north.

    The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

[36mThe Tollhouse[0;37m
    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

    The road here passes through some large fields of grain, a sign that a
large city is nearby. Looking westward, the towers of Vingaard Keep are
visible perched atop a hill with the city's walls nearby. The road
continues north to a junction of roads from other parts of the continent
and a small tollhouse that stands watch over the intersection. To the
south, the road crosses the Vingaard River via a ford in the river.

[36mThe West Bank[0;37m
    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

[36mFording the Vingaard River[0;37m
    The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal
place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,
scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

[36mA Narrow Road[0;37m
    A narrow road leads deep into a thick forest of very tall trees and
north it leads through the plains of Abanasinia. Around you are many trees
but not as many as to the south. The road runs in the near shadows of the
Kharolis mountains which can be seen off to the west, beyond a great lake.
The mountains appear to run north for some distance before ending. The
plains spread out to the north from here for many leagues.

[36mAt the Edge of Nearfields[0;37m
    You are on a narrow trail that cuts between large fields of grain and
the huge vallenwood trees that cover the Solace Vale. Stretching out to the
north, these fields are known as Nearfields to the citizens of Solace
because of their proximity to the small town. A thick forest of pine trees
lies to the west, beyond which the Crystalmir Lake can be seen. To the east
this dirt trail merges with a wide road.

slicing through the cool air. Ahead, the forest begins to pull together,
trees crowding against each other, and vines twisting about the

that some of the forest has become interlaced into a poetic arch, crossing
the space just above you. Through this arch, the trail continues to the

    A mild and warm stretch of beach protects you here from the sea in
three directions. Strong waves break and crash upon rocks and sand tempered
by the relentless passage of time. Looking down, you can see small
shellfish and debris marching up and down the shore, slave to the tides.
Surrounded by the landscape here, almost out of place, an ancient, solitary
treestump of petrified wood serves as a reminder that not all was wet in
times long past, and that this sea is still new in the eyes of the gods.

[36mElven Arch[0;37m
    A breeze, carrying the scent of wildflowers, washes gently over you,
and departs with the quietest of whispers. Overhead, the white clouds mold
and twist themselves, splashing against the shores of heavens unseen. The
azure sky, peeking carefully between frothy, white lumps, begins to show
the first signs of night as darkness begins to pull itself across the
horizon. Retreating, the sun offers the land its warmth, beams of gold
slicing through the cool air. Ahead, the forest begins to pull together,
trees crowding against each other, and vines twisting about the
moss-covered trunks, creating a wall of vegetation. Strangely, it seems
that some of the forest has become interlaced into a poetic arch, crossing
the space just above you. Through this arch, the trail continues to the
north.

    The forest presses inward, pushing and shoving at the small, dirty
trail. Ancient trees line the path, reaching out and digging their hard
roots, like tentacles, into the muddy forest floor. The uneasy roar of
silence overwhelms the sweet chirpings of a Thrush, and pushes its way
through the forest undergrowth, rushing over your feet like tiny waves.
Breathing in the humid air, a sensation of drowning overcomes you, broken
only by the occasional cool breeze from the south.

    Suddenly opening up, the path cuts across a large area cleared of any
major, and natural, obstacles. Rising from the green grass, erupting in a
shower of stone, a large cliff curls about this clearing. Against the
cliff, a waterfall showers down onto the rocks, and disappears underneath
the fertile land, flowing to realms unknown. Bubbling incessantly, the
crystalline liquid rests momentarily amongst a small patch of reeds hugging
the base of the cliff. In the middle of the clearing, a circular patch of
dead grass has been cleared by intelligent hands, the center being coated
with soot and half-burnt logs. Obviously, this clearing has served as a
camping ground for travellers.

    The mud and dirt have now given away to a thick covering of white
gravel. Alongside the trail, small clusters of green grass flap in the wind
like tiny battle flags, and clumps of snow lie melting in the sun. The air,
once warm, has become dry and cool, your breath shooting out in plumes of
hot steam. Branches droop dangerously over the path, the leaves covered in
a thin layer of frozen dew, and icicles, as sharp as daggers, hang from the
wood, sparkling in the light.

    A mighty oak tree dominates the center of the path. Spreading its
ice-covered branches upwards toward the sky, the long, gnarled fingers hang
over the surrounding area as a mother protecting her children. Scarred and
colored a fading brown, the trunk has become firmly embedded in the forest
floor over the last several hundred years. Walking past it, stiff blades of
frozen grass crumble and shatter beneath your feet, the freezing
temperatures beginning to numb your toes. In the distance, the sobs of a
crying female can be heard. Past these sounds, to the north, the path
allows you to move closer to the mountains.

    Stabbing the clear skies, the peaks of the mountains stretch upwards to
the heavens. A ring of clouds encircles the very pinnacle, hugging the cold
rock and protecting the great sheets of ice and snow that blanket the solid
cliffs. Within the clouds, strange shapes flit and soar about, breaking
away from the froth, and, then, meld and mold themselves into contorted
shapes, eventually merging back into their snow-filled homes and
disappearing from sight.

[36mSacred Passage[0;37m
    The trees, the foliage, sparkle in the light, covered in a thin layer
of frost. Seemingly painted on, the frozen dew attaches itself to the oak
trees, swirling patterns turning the hard wood into a natural canvas.
Across the ground, just outside the trail, tiny footprints have been left
behind, and lead in a variety of directions, twisting through the woods. At
your feet, thin ruts are the only signs of passing carts, and they become
deeper as the path continues to the north. Oddly, the wheel tracks only
begin at this point, and, even though the earth has been frozen by the
mountain's frigid winds, the imprints are deeply cut into the black soil.
To the west, hidden behind a tree leaning to one side, its roots being
slowly, tortuously ripped from the forest floor, a pile of brush lies
covered with clumps of snow.

like the gods of elements, a waterfall can be seen tripping down the sides,
the slopes, of the snow-covered mountains. Most unlike the incessant
murmuring of this fall, the River of The Dead snaps harshly against the

continues to the east and, then, seems to curve southward, moving dutifully

    Great chunks of ice and snow collapse into the swampy waters, sliding
down a small slope to the north and finally rolling into the river. Here,
the current has increased in strength, and scummy water pulls the boat
gently toward the south. In that direction, just inside a thick line of
trees hanging over the tepid water, great pillars of precious metals rise
from the forest floor and climb great heights. From within, floating
outward, the music of a flute can be heard hovering above the river. Before

confusion. Twirling about, a great whirlpool has been created near the
southern bank, sucking in the forest debris scattered on the dull and oily
surface of this mountain stream.

    A tall, rocky overhang juts from the southern slope, casting a shadow
over the trail. The steep rock formation is caked with green moss, and its
steep, smooth surface makes it impossible to scale. Tall boulders lay
against the rocky overhang and block any movement in the eastern direction.
The forest opens up to the west, a magnificant spectacle of majestic trees,
light green foliage, and bustling wildlife. The only clear passage down the
ridge is a narrow chute through the trees to the north.

    The verdant forest buzzes with wildlife activity. Several small, brown
squirrels race across the ground in competition over fallen walnuts, each
scrambling in erratic patterns. A massive oak tree is sprawled across the
forest floor, propped at an awkward angle by the unlucky trees that caught
its fall. Massive roots of the fallen giant are exposed where its mangled
base has been ripped from the dark, rich earth. The wide trunk and gentle
incline of this felled tree make it quite easy to climb. A tall ridge rises
to the west that seems impossible to scale and the forest is too thick to
traverse to the north. The lush forest basin continues to the east and

    Water splashes and gurgles as a small stream forms tiny rapids over
rounded rocks that break the water's surface. The spring water is
refreshingly cool and clear, showing a depth of about ten feet. The muddy
western bank is too steep and slick to climb, but there appears to be a
better crossing point to the south. A large oak tree extends at an awkward
angle over the waters edge, most of its mass hanging well over the bubbling

have exposed the ancient tree's roots. The woods thicken to the east, and
the muddy bank parallels the stream to the north and south.

of a tree along the path; only the battered skull of a deer remains. A

trail of dark smoke can be seen through small gaps in the canopy to the
southwest. To the west, several deer flee to the north, running from some

    The forest is a vibrant symphony of sounds; birds' melodious calls,
buzzing insects, and the light rustling of leaves all blend together in
harmony. Tall trees block out most of the sky here, but enough sunlight
finds its way down through the canopy during the day to allow the growth of
many shrubs and bushes beneath their branches. They grow especially thick
towards the south and west, appearing to block further travel in either
direction. Underfoot is a vast assortment of creeping vines, dry leaves,
fallen branches, and lost twigs of all sizes and shapes. As peaceful as
this place seems, the distinctive smell of something burning wafts along
the breeze and is accompanied by a vague sense of something darker lurking
nearby.

    The forest has been greatly thinned here, providing a clear view of the

trees once stood litter the ground. At the center of the devastation lies a
crude pit, blackened and charred from heavy use. Within it lie dozens of
long branches and whole saplings loosely grouped together, bright orange
flames dancing along their lengths. Heavy feet have carved a path here,
encircling the fire and heading off in all directions.

[36mA Topped Pillar[0;37m
    What was once a magnificent monolith has collapsed in a southerly
direction and now lies broken into several pieces, crumbling with age. The
severed ends of the pillar are rough and gradually breaking away but the
face of the stone is still surprisingly smooth and polished, having
weathered the passage of time remarkably well. The formerly utmost section
has fallen such that it is propped up at one end by an ancient oak,
providing some measure of shelter beneath it. The rest of the pieces all
still lay roughly where they originally fell, preserving some semblance of
the pillar's original appearance albeit in a horizontal fashion. Slightly
northward of the pillar's broken base lie the vague remains of a demolished
stone wall, its fractured segments mostly buried beneath the forest floor.

    A sleek stone barrier rises roughly ten feet above the ground here: the
only stable remains of an ancient enclosure that once fortified the entire
area where the troll's camp now resides. The rest of the broken fragments
leave an easily followed trail marking out the vague skeleton of the
crumbled wall. Apparently it once ran east-to-west where trees now stand to
the north before forming a corner towards the northwest and then running
deep into the impassible foliage to the south. But that was long ago and
the forest has since reclaimed the area, save for the broad stretch of wall
to the west. Clenching tree roots, crawling underbrush and a loose mat of
dirt and decayed leaves have covered most of the toppled remains and
threaten to erase even a trace of the wall's existence in time to come.

    The hidden chamber has a circular base of cobblestone, with slick
vaulted walls that arch overhead. A large ring of pitch black round stone
forms a wide perimeter of about six paces in the center of the room, where
the faint outlines of a massive pentagram lie in its center. Every thing in
the room, from floor to the sparse furnishings to the domed ceiling has
been charred black from exposure to tremendous amounts of heat over a long
period of time. Near the charred door to the east lay a scorched set of

[36mAn Ancient Barricade[0;37m
    A sleek stone barrier rises roughly ten feet above the ground here: the
only stable remains of an ancient enclosure that once fortified the entire
area where the troll's camp now resides. The rest of the broken fragments
leave an easily followed trail marking out the vague skeleton of the
crumbled wall. Apparently it once ran east-to-west where trees now stand to
the north before forming a corner towards the northwest and then running
deep into the impassible foliage to the south. But that was long ago and
the forest has since reclaimed the area, save for the broad stretch of wall
to the west. Clenching tree roots, crawling underbrush and a loose mat of
dirt and decayed leaves have covered most of the toppled remains and
threaten to erase even a trace of the wall's existence in time to come.

    What was once a magnificent monolith has collapsed in a southerly
direction and now lies broken into several pieces, crumbling with age. The
severed ends of the pillar are rough and gradually breaking away but the
face of the stone is still surprisingly smooth and polished, having
weathered the passage of time remarkably well. The formerly utmost section
has fallen such that it is propped up at one end by an ancient oak,
providing some measure of shelter beneath it. The rest of the pieces all
still lay roughly where they originally fell, preserving some semblance of
the pillar's original appearance albeit in a horizontal fashion. Slightly
northward of the pillar's broken base lie the vague remains of a demolished
stone wall, its fractured segments mostly buried beneath the forest floor.

[36mA Topped Pillar[0;37m
    What was once a magnificent monolith has collapsed in a southerly
direction and now lies broken into several pieces, crumbling with age. The
severed ends of the pillar are rough and gradually breaking away but the
face of the stone is still surprisingly smooth and polished, having
weathered the passage of time remarkably well. The formerly utmost section
has fallen such that it is propped up at one end by an ancient oak,
providing some measure of shelter beneath it. The rest of the pieces all
still lay roughly where they originally fell, preserving some semblance of
the pillar's original appearance albeit in a horizontal fashion. Slightly
northward of the pillar's broken base lie the vague remains of a demolished
stone wall, its fractured segments mostly buried beneath the forest floor.

[36mA Ruined Dwelling[0;37m
    Almost completely hidden by the thick stands of trees, the remnants of
a strange building stand here. Only the far western wall is still intact,
dull grey in color and extraordinarily smooth to the touch. It is certainly
made of stone but no seams are visible at the wall corners or between the
floor and ceiling, as if the stone was poured in molten form to create the
simple building all at once. Time has not treated the brittle material
well, though, and now parts of the southern wall, most of the northern
wall, and a large portion of the proper entrance to the east have broken
off and crumbled into the dirt. All but a fraction of the ceiling has caved
in as well, and now serves as a second layer of flooring for the building
rather than a way of keeping out the elements.

    The walls, floor, and even the towering ceiling of this enormous cave
have all been painted a dauntingly dark-red color, very reminiscent of
dried blood. Leaping and dancing across the bloodied walls are many twisted
shadows, thrown by a small fire crackling under a bubbling pot. A pile of
bones and many bodies are scattered throughout the cave, giving the
distinct impression that this place is used to make bloody sacrifices as a
part of some dark spiritual rite. The carnage this all brings to mind
nearly obfuscates the construction of the cave, which has been meticulously
engineered to create a perfectly cylindrical tunnel and is also amazingly
well polished. The floor of the cave drops away sharply to the south,
leading downwards into the unknown while the cavern exits towards a large
campfire to the north or west into the forest.

flames dancing along their lengths. Heavy feet have carved a path here,

severed ends of the pillar are rough and gradually breaking away but the
face of the stone is still surprisingly smooth and polished, having
weathered the passage of time remarkably well. The formerly utmost section
has fallen such that it is propped up at one end by an ancient oak,
providing some measure of shelter beneath it. The rest of the pieces all
still lay roughly where they originally fell, preserving some semblance of
the pillar's original appearance albeit in a horizontal fashion. Slightly
northward of the pillar's broken base lie the vague remains of a demolished
stone wall, its fractured segments mostly buried beneath the forest floor.

    A sleek stone barrier rises roughly ten feet above the ground here: the
only stable remains of an ancient enclosure that once fortified the entire
area where the troll's camp now resides. The rest of the broken fragments
leave an easily followed trail marking out the vague skeleton of the
crumbled wall. Apparently it once ran east-to-west where trees now stand to
the north before forming a corner towards the northwest and then running
deep into the impassible foliage to the south. But that was long ago and
the forest has since reclaimed the area, save for the broad stretch of wall
to the west. Clenching tree roots, crawling underbrush and a loose mat of
dirt and decayed leaves have covered most of the toppled remains and
threaten to erase even a trace of the wall's existence in time to come.

leave an easily followed trail marking out the vague skeleton of the

the north before forming a corner towards the northwest and then running
deep into the impassible foliage to the south. But that was long ago and
the forest has since reclaimed the area, save for the broad stretch of wall

forms a wide perimeter of about six paces in the center of the room, where
the faint outlines of a massive pentagram lie in its center. Every thing in
the room, from floor to the sparse furnishings to the domed ceiling has
been charred black from exposure to tremendous amounts of heat over a long

    What was once a magnificent monolith has collapsed in a southerly
direction and now lies broken into several pieces, crumbling with age. The
severed ends of the pillar are rough and gradually breaking away but the
face of the stone is still surprisingly smooth and polished, having
weathered the passage of time remarkably well. The formerly utmost section
has fallen such that it is propped up at one end by an ancient oak,
providing some measure of shelter beneath it. The rest of the pieces all
still lay roughly where they originally fell, preserving some semblance of
the pillar's original appearance albeit in a horizontal fashion. Slightly
northward of the pillar's broken base lie the vague remains of a demolished
stone wall, its fractured segments mostly buried beneath the forest floor.

    Almost completely hidden by the thick stands of trees, the remnants of
a strange building stand here. Only the far western wall is still intact,
dull grey in color and extraordinarily smooth to the touch. It is certainly
made of stone but no seams are visible at the wall corners or between the
floor and ceiling, as if the stone was poured in molten form to create the
simple building all at once. Time has not treated the brittle material
well, though, and now parts of the southern wall, most of the northern
wall, and a large portion of the proper entrance to the east have broken
off and crumbled into the dirt. All but a fraction of the ceiling has caved
in as well, and now serves as a second layer of flooring for the building
rather than a way of keeping out the elements.

dried blood. Leaping and dancing across the bloodied walls are many twisted
shadows, thrown by a small fire crackling under a bubbling pot. A pile of
bones and many bodies are scattered throughout the cave, giving the
distinct impression that this place is used to make bloody sacrifices as a
part of some dark spiritual rite. The carnage this all brings to mind
nearly obfuscates the construction of the cave, which has been meticulously
engineered to create a perfectly cylindrical tunnel and is also amazingly
well polished. The floor of the cave drops away sharply to the south,
leading downwards into the unknown while the cavern exits towards a large
campfire to the north or west into the forest.

trees once stood litter the ground. At the center of the devastation lies a
crude pit, blackened and charred from heavy use. Within it lie dozens of
long branches and whole saplings loosely grouped together, bright orange
flames dancing along their lengths. Heavy feet have carved a path here,
encircling the fire and heading off in all directions.

able to accommodate several of even the tallest trolls side-by-side. The
walls themselves are amazingly smooth to the touch, marking them as clearly
artificial and just as clearly beyond the ability of any troll to sculpt.
There are no clues as to who created this place or even how long it has
been here, but considering all the filth the trolls have left behind it's
unlikely they would want to reclaim it. Aside from the debris littering the
ground absolutely no objects or decorations at all can be found, implying
very plain taste in both its original and current owners. The cave extends
downward into blackness, and exits back west towards the campfire.

[36mA Large Cave Opening[0;37m
    The roof of the cave yawns widely overhead and to the sides, easily
able to accommodate several of even the tallest trolls side-by-side. The
walls themselves are amazingly smooth to the touch, marking them as clearly
artificial and just as clearly beyond the ability of any troll to sculpt.
There are no clues as to who created this place or even how long it has
been here, but considering all the filth the trolls have left behind it's
unlikely they would want to reclaim it. Aside from the debris littering the
ground absolutely no objects or decorations at all can be found, implying
very plain taste in both its original and current owners. The cave extends
downward into blackness, and exits back west towards the campfire.

[36mA Sprawling Campfire[0;37m
    The forest has been greatly thinned here, providing a clear view of the
sky as well as the forest floor. Severed trunks and deep pits where tall
trees once stood litter the ground. At the center of the devastation lies a
crude pit, blackened and charred from heavy use. Within it lie dozens of
long branches and whole saplings loosely grouped together, bright orange
flames dancing along their lengths. Heavy feet have carved a path here,
encircling the fire and heading off in all directions.

[36mA Crimson Cave[0;37m
    The walls, floor, and even the towering ceiling of this enormous cave
have all been painted a dauntingly dark-red color, very reminiscent of
dried blood. Leaping and dancing across the bloodied walls are many twisted
shadows, thrown by a small fire crackling under a bubbling pot. A pile of
bones and many bodies are scattered throughout the cave, giving the
distinct impression that this place is used to make bloody sacrifices as a
part of some dark spiritual rite. The carnage this all brings to mind
nearly obfuscates the construction of the cave, which has been meticulously
engineered to create a perfectly cylindrical tunnel and is also amazingly
well polished. The floor of the cave drops away sharply to the south,
leading downwards into the unknown while the cavern exits towards a large
campfire to the north or west into the forest.

    The walls, floor, and even the towering ceiling of this enormous cave
have all been painted a dauntingly dark-red color, very reminiscent of
dried blood. Leaping and dancing across the bloodied walls are many twisted
shadows, thrown by a small fire crackling under a bubbling pot. A pile of
bones and many bodies are scattered throughout the cave, giving the
distinct impression that this place is used to make bloody sacrifices as a
part of some dark spiritual rite. The carnage this all brings to mind
nearly obfuscates the construction of the cave, which has been meticulously
engineered to create a perfectly cylindrical tunnel and is also amazingly
well polished. The floor of the cave drops away sharply to the south,
leading downwards into the unknown while the cavern exits towards a large
campfire to the north or west into the forest.

    Almost completely hidden by the thick stands of trees, the remnants of
a strange building stand here. Only the far western wall is still intact,
dull grey in color and extraordinarily smooth to the touch. It is certainly
made of stone but no seams are visible at the wall corners or between the
floor and ceiling, as if the stone was poured in molten form to create the
simple building all at once. Time has not treated the brittle material
well, though, and now parts of the southern wall, most of the northern
wall, and a large portion of the proper entrance to the east have broken
off and crumbled into the dirt. All but a fraction of the ceiling has caved
in as well, and now serves as a second layer of flooring for the building
rather than a way of keeping out the elements.

trees once stood litter the ground. At the center of the devastation lies a
crude pit, blackened and charred from heavy use. Within it lie dozens of
long branches and whole saplings loosely grouped together, bright orange
flames dancing along their lengths. Heavy feet have carved a path here,
encircling the fire and heading off in all directions.

    The roof of the cave yawns widely overhead and to the sides, easily
able to accommodate several of even the tallest trolls side-by-side. The
walls themselves are amazingly smooth to the touch, marking them as clearly
artificial and just as clearly beyond the ability of any troll to sculpt.
There are no clues as to who created this place or even how long it has
been here, but considering all the filth the trolls have left behind it's
unlikely they would want to reclaim it. Aside from the debris littering the
ground absolutely no objects or decorations at all can be found, implying
very plain taste in both its original and current owners. The cave extends
downward into blackness, and exits back west towards the campfire.

The polished walls are damp with moisture and a shallow, trough-like puddle
stretches along the entire central dip in the cylindrical tunnel's floor.
The pool has a very thick consistency and generates a sickening stench,
revealing it as a mixture of water, half-eaten meals, and much more that
has passed beyond the point of recognition. Fortunately, the cavern's wide,
unobstructed passages provide a steady flow of fresh air to abate the odor.
Unfortunately however, the breeze does nothing to help the disgusting and

[36mThe Heart of the Den[0;37m
    This is the core of the troll community, buried deep under the earth to
protect the fragile young trolls from any outside threats. The area is
about as "homey" as one would expect for a colony of trolls. The puddle of
filth that runs through the entire cavern's floor is even more grotesque in
this section of the tunnel, with several carcasses meant to serve as food
for the young soaking in the dark ichor. Heaps of fur and clothing stripped
from the bodies are spread along the sides of the cylindrical tunnel, well
above the edges of the cesspool that fills the floor's central dip. Other
colonies have also made their home here: that of carrion worms, grubs and
other vile pests that live amongst the corpses. The smell of rotting and
decayed flesh is nearly unbearable despite the appreciable ventilation of
the cavern's wide tunnels. Sharply changing course once again the tunnel
leads north one way and west through the other, both into darkness.

[36mThe Burial Ground[0;37m
    This portion of the cave is filled with bones and rotting remains, the
acrid stench of which is nearly overwhelming. Apparently everything the
trolls kill are eventually dragged or dropped into this room after they're
finished with the bodies. Several troll bones and corpses also lie here -
perhaps the victims of battle - though no effort has been made to arrange
or identify them. A long, vile puddle runs along the dip of the cylindrical
tunnel, compounding the smell and soaking the bodies to increase the rate
of decay. The tunnel climbs steeply to the north and bends eastward.

    This is the core of the troll community, buried deep under the earth to
protect the fragile young trolls from any outside threats. The area is
about as "homey" as one would expect for a colony of trolls. The puddle of
filth that runs through the entire cavern's floor is even more grotesque in
this section of the tunnel, with several carcasses meant to serve as food
for the young soaking in the dark ichor. Heaps of fur and clothing stripped
from the bodies are spread along the sides of the cylindrical tunnel, well
above the edges of the cesspool that fills the floor's central dip. Other
colonies have also made their home here: that of carrion worms, grubs and
other vile pests that live amongst the corpses. The smell of rotting and
decayed flesh is nearly unbearable despite the appreciable ventilation of
the cavern's wide tunnels. Sharply changing course once again the tunnel
leads north one way and west through the other, both into darkness.

    The unnatural cave abruptly halts its previous course and changes
direction, heading sharply south one way and steeply upward out the other.
The polished walls are damp with moisture and a shallow, trough-like puddle
stretches along the entire central dip in the cylindrical tunnel's floor.
The pool has a very thick consistency and generates a sickening stench,
revealing it as a mixture of water, half-eaten meals, and much more that
has passed beyond the point of recognition. Fortunately, the cavern's wide,
unobstructed passages provide a steady flow of fresh air to abate the odor.
Unfortunately however, the breeze does nothing to help the disgusting and
slimy feel of sloshing through the puddle.

    The unnatural cave abruptly halts its previous course and changes
direction, heading sharply south one way and steeply upward out the other.
The polished walls are damp with moisture and a shallow, trough-like puddle
stretches along the entire central dip in the cylindrical tunnel's floor.
The pool has a very thick consistency and generates a sickening stench,
revealing it as a mixture of water, half-eaten meals, and much more that
has passed beyond the point of recognition. Fortunately, the cavern's wide,
unobstructed passages provide a steady flow of fresh air to abate the odor.
Unfortunately however, the breeze does nothing to help the disgusting and
slimy feel of sloshing through the puddle.

    This is the core of the troll community, buried deep under the earth to
protect the fragile young trolls from any outside threats. The area is
about as "homey" as one would expect for a colony of trolls. The puddle of
filth that runs through the entire cavern's floor is even more grotesque in
this section of the tunnel, with several carcasses meant to serve as food
for the young soaking in the dark ichor. Heaps of fur and clothing stripped
from the bodies are spread along the sides of the cylindrical tunnel, well
above the edges of the cesspool that fills the floor's central dip. Other
colonies have also made their home here: that of carrion worms, grubs and
other vile pests that live amongst the corpses. The smell of rotting and
decayed flesh is nearly unbearable despite the appreciable ventilation of
the cavern's wide tunnels. Sharply changing course once again the tunnel
leads north one way and west through the other, both into darkness.

    This is the core of the troll community, buried deep under the earth to
protect the fragile young trolls from any outside threats. The area is
about as "homey" as one would expect for a colony of trolls. The puddle of
filth that runs through the entire cavern's floor is even more grotesque in
this section of the tunnel, with several carcasses meant to serve as food
for the young soaking in the dark ichor. Heaps of fur and clothing stripped
from the bodies are spread along the sides of the cylindrical tunnel, well
above the edges of the cesspool that fills the floor's central dip. Other
colonies have also made their home here: that of carrion worms, grubs and
other vile pests that live amongst the corpses. The smell of rotting and
decayed flesh is nearly unbearable despite the appreciable ventilation of
the cavern's wide tunnels. Sharply changing course once again the tunnel
leads north one way and west through the other, both into darkness.

[36mThe Heart of the Den[0;37m
    This is the core of the troll community, buried deep under the earth to
protect the fragile young trolls from any outside threats. The area is
about as "homey" as one would expect for a colony of trolls. The puddle of
filth that runs through the entire cavern's floor is even more grotesque in
this section of the tunnel, with several carcasses meant to serve as food
for the young soaking in the dark ichor. Heaps of fur and clothing stripped
from the bodies are spread along the sides of the cylindrical tunnel, well
above the edges of the cesspool that fills the floor's central dip. Other
colonies have also made their home here: that of carrion worms, grubs and
other vile pests that live amongst the corpses. The smell of rotting and
decayed flesh is nearly unbearable despite the appreciable ventilation of
the cavern's wide tunnels. Sharply changing course once again the tunnel
leads north one way and west through the other, both into darkness.

    This portion of the cave is filled with bones and rotting remains, the
acrid stench of which is nearly overwhelming. Apparently everything the
trolls kill are eventually dragged or dropped into this room after they're
finished with the bodies. Several troll bones and corpses also lie here -
perhaps the victims of battle - though no effort has been made to arrange
or identify them. A long, vile puddle runs along the dip of the cylindrical
tunnel, compounding the smell and soaking the bodies to increase the rate
of decay. The tunnel climbs steeply to the north and bends eastward.

dried blood. Leaping and dancing across the bloodied walls are many twisted
shadows, thrown by a small fire crackling under a bubbling pot. A pile of
bones and many bodies are scattered throughout the cave, giving the
distinct impression that this place is used to make bloody sacrifices as a
part of some dark spiritual rite. The carnage this all brings to mind
nearly obfuscates the construction of the cave, which has been meticulously
engineered to create a perfectly cylindrical tunnel and is also amazingly
well polished. The floor of the cave drops away sharply to the south,
leading downwards into the unknown while the cavern exits towards a large
campfire to the north or west into the forest.

    The forest is a vibrant symphony of sounds; birds' melodious calls,
buzzing insects, and the light rustling of leaves all blend together in
harmony. Tall trees block out most of the sky here, but enough sunlight
finds its way down through the canopy during the day to allow the growth of
many shrubs and bushes beneath their branches. They grow especially thick
towards the south and west, appearing to block further travel in either
direction. Underfoot is a vast assortment of creeping vines, dry leaves,
fallen branches, and lost twigs of all sizes and shapes. As peaceful as
this place seems, the distinctive smell of something burning wafts along
the breeze and is accompanied by a vague sense of something darker lurking
nearby.

continues to the north, and the hint of smoke may be seen in the skyline to
the west.

    A clear, cool stream flows in from the south and snakes through the
forest to the north. Tall, muddy banks line the tight curve where the
stream cuts to the west. Small ripples break the water's surface, showing a
shallow crossing point to the west where the bank is lined with large
weeping willows. The wooded area is covered with tall oaks and maples, and
the sky is barely visible. The ridge running north and south dips very low
to the east, making this pass the best access point to the other side.
Several gaps in the eastern trees offer a stunning view of continued lush
forest growth beyond the pass.

Wading through the tall grass, you cross the narrow pass to the forest
beyond.
[36mThe Entrance to the Elven Village of Silvertrout[0;37m
    A thriving, verdant forest lay between two tall, gray ridges. A small
trail marks the entrance to a quaint, elven village seemingly hidden in a
stunning, wooded valley. Massive oak trees dominate the rolling forest
terrain, providing a shaded canopy over the pristine forest. The calls of
exotic birds echo off the magnificent oaks and towering cliffs on both
sides of the valley. Thick, green foliage provides a stunning contrast to
the dark, fertile forest soil. The rich, black earth produces colorful,
vibrant specimens of flowers, bushes, and ivy, all teeming with insect
life. The dim outline of small, round huts are almost perfectly camouflaged
by the dense, green vegetation. A narrow pass leads west through tall grass
and tree cover.

[36mAn Intersection of Paths[0;37m
    Several paths meet on a rocky section of exposed bedrock, slightly
elevated above the surrounding foliage. Tiny, bright red spider mites, only
the size of a small grain of salt, crawl across the rocky, uneven surface.
Long, twisted thick vines hang from branches spanning the trail just out of
arms reach. The musical sound of bird life is nearly deafening above, where
hundreds of black birds have gathered and create quite a commotion. Two
long lines of well organized huts begin to the south and disappear in the
haze of the thick forest air. A small path heading due east runs directly
to the the centerpiece of the village - the ceremonial ring. Another well
trod trail picks up to the north snaking through more domed dwellings and
tall trees. Tall, thin shapes duck in and out of nearby huts, and the sound
of elven tongue is barely audible over the intense bird activity. Two watch
stands are barely visible in the sprawling oaks to the north and south,
well hidden in large leafy oaks.

[36mA Path Through the Village[0;37m
    A narrow path has been beaten through the green forest, circling the
elven village's ceremonial ring. Tall wild grass and large green bushes
with small, red berries line the sides of the trail. The sweet sound of
innocent laughter emanates from a cluster of elven girls playing further
down the forest trail. A lanky, scruffy elven lad balances on the white
stones of the ceremonial ring, pretending to navigate a narrow branch high
in the treetops. Leather-bound structures are scattered in the tree line,
blending seamlessly with the brown tapestry of the dense, wooded forest.
High above the curving trail, a watch stand is perched in a sprawling oak,
overlooking the northwest corner of the quaint elven village. Large knots
and low hanging branches make the large oak quite easy to scale, even for
an unseasoned climber. The narrow dirt path bends to the south and east,
tracing the outskirts of the elven village.

    A wooden platform large enough to hold two elven sentries is perched
high in tall oaks. The platform is constructed from thick wooden branches
lashed together, encircling the wide oak trunk. A large basket of arrows is
fastened overhead, and several long bows and supplies rest on a shelf built
into the fork of a thick branch. The bottom of the platform is camouflaged
with leaves and branches, making the perch quite difficult to spot from the
trail below. Large gaps in the green canopy provide excellent view of the
elven village. Small stakes imbedded in the oak trunk provide means to
climb up and down the tall tree. A rope bridge leads south to another
watchstand positioned atop a sprawling oak.

[36mA Watch Stand High in the Trees[0;37m
    A wooden platform large enough to hold two elven sentries is perched
high in tall oaks. The platform is constructed from thick wooden branches
lashed together, encircling the wide oak trunk. A large basket of arrows is
fastened overhead, and several long bows and supplies rest on a shelf built
into the fork of a thick branch. The bottom of the platform is camouflaged
with leaves and branches, making the perch quite difficult to spot from the
trail below. Large gaps in the green canopy provide excellent view of the
elven village. Small stakes imbedded in the oak trunk provide means to
climb up and down the tall tree. A rope bridge leads south to another
watchstand positioned atop a sprawling oak.

[36mA Path Through the Village[0;37m
    A narrow path has been beaten through the green forest, circling the
elven village's ceremonial ring. Tall wild grass and large green bushes
with small, red berries line the sides of the trail. The sweet sound of
innocent laughter emanates from a cluster of elven girls playing further
down the forest trail. A lanky, scruffy elven lad balances on the white
stones of the ceremonial ring, pretending to navigate a narrow branch high
in the treetops. Leather-bound structures are scattered in the tree line,
blending seamlessly with the brown tapestry of the dense, wooded forest.
High above the curving trail, a watch stand is perched in a sprawling oak,
overlooking the northwest corner of the quaint elven village. Large knots
and low hanging branches make the large oak quite easy to scale, even for
an unseasoned climber. The narrow dirt path bends to the south and east,
tracing the outskirts of the elven village.

[36mA Path Through the Village[0;37m
    A narrow dirt path rounds the northeastern corner of the quaint elven
village. A large, black snake slithers quickly across the trail,
disappearing in a thick maze of tangled green ivy. Several small mud huts
are scattered deeper in the forest, lying in the shade of massive oak
trees. The forest terrain grows denser traveling west on the narrow dirt
path, where a large, strange hut rests under the twisted branches of a
moss-covered tree. A tall oak rises near the bend in the path, and a small
platform is barely visible through the thick green foliage. A small rope
ladder is coiled at the base of the platform, far out of reach.
Occasionally, the rustling of leaves above betray the presence of an elven
sentry watching from above. To the southwest, large white stone are stacked
neatly three feet tall and form the outer perimeter of the tribe's
ceremonial ring. In the distance, the melodic voices of elven children
giggling echo through the tranquil forest.

[36mA Junction of Trails[0;37m
    A large intersection of trampled dirt paths lies under a lush canopy of
tall maples, arching oaks, and a few scattered pine trees. Small river
pebbles are imbedded in the dirt path, compressed some time ago when the
trail was muddied after a hard rain. Small patches of tall wild grass bend
over the edges of the winding trail, peppered with exotic wild flowers. The
white painted stones of the tribal ring barely show through the dense wall
of foliage to the west. The main trail skirts the perimeter of the forest
village, winding to the north and south. Another path leads east, narrower
than the rest, through a tunnel of overhanging branches, leading to a
large, domed hut resting under a magnificent oak.

[36mBefore the Hut of the Leather Maker[0;37m
    A large, domed dwelling rests under a giant oak near the eastern edge
of the Kagonesti village. A circle grove of oaks wraps around the elven
hut, giving the hut a secluded forest location. The large hut is supported
by long, arching poles lashed together with rope. The hut's walls are
fashioned from several large animal skins pieced together. Several kettles
varying in shapes, color, and sizes line the perimeter of the old hut.
Although surrounded in natural beauty, the smell of urine and pungent fumes
are nearly overwhelming. No doubt the village has pushed the leather maker
as far to the perimeter of the village as possible to mitigate the elf's
foul curing brews. Narrow paths snake through the forest to the west and
south under the thick tree canopy.

[36mBefore the Hut of the Leather Maker[0;37m
    A large, domed dwelling rests under a giant oak near the eastern edge
of the Kagonesti village. A circle grove of oaks wraps around the elven
hut, giving the hut a secluded forest location. The large hut is supported
by long, arching poles lashed together with rope. The hut's walls are
fashioned from several large animal skins pieced together. Several kettles
varying in shapes, color, and sizes line the perimeter of the old hut.
Although surrounded in natural beauty, the smell of urine and pungent fumes
are nearly overwhelming. No doubt the village has pushed the leather maker
as far to the perimeter of the village as possible to mitigate the elf's
foul curing brews. Narrow paths snake through the forest to the west and
south under the thick tree canopy.

[36mA Forest Training Ground[0;37m
    Tall branched trees provide a canopy over the trampled, dirt forest
floor. The elves have meticulously cleared the brush to build a large,
circular practice area amongst the trees. A line of oaks to the east have
large circular targets strapped to their trunks. Loose straw and broken
arrows litter the ground at the base of the targets. High up in the trees
several young elves practice climbing and leaping from branch to branch,
stalking imaginary prey. Sitting on a rocky outcrop, a young warrior
watches with great interest as a young male elf hones thrust and parry
techniques against an older sparring partner. Narrow dirt trails leave the
training ground to the north and west.

[36mA Forest Training Ground[0;37m
    Tall branched trees provide a canopy over the trampled, dirt forest
floor. The elves have meticulously cleared the brush to build a large,
circular practice area amongst the trees. A line of oaks to the east have
large circular targets strapped to their trunks. Loose straw and broken
arrows litter the ground at the base of the targets. High up in the trees
several young elves practice climbing and leaping from branch to branch,
stalking imaginary prey. Sitting on a rocky outcrop, a young warrior
watches with great interest as a young male elf hones thrust and parry
techniques against an older sparring partner. Narrow dirt trails leave the
training ground to the north and west.

avoiding natural barriers such as large trees, bushes, and rocky
outcroppings. Tall bushes with bright red berries cover the north side of
the trail, obscuring the village's ceremonial ring located on the other
side. A tall, lanky female elf is startled while picking berries and
scampers away, leaving a trail of berries on the dirt path. Seizing the
opportunity, an exotic black bird with yellow and orange stripes swoops
down to dirt trail and inspects the abandoned treats. The sounds of elves
sparring echoes from a wide clearing opening to the east. The main trail
bends to the north and west, circling around the center of the Kagonesti
village of Silvertrout.

    Several dirt trails meet under a tall canopy of oak trees near the
southern reaches of the valley. The main trail is well trod and littered
with dried leaves, fallen acorns, and dried twigs from the looming trees.
The well trod path runs east and west, skirting the small elven village.
Large platforms and small lodge are constructed high in the arching oaks,
partially hidden in the thick green foliage. The large, white stones
forming the outer wall of the tribal ring are barely visible through the
thick, green wall of brush directly north. A massive branch angles down,
near the intersection of paths only a few feet above arms reach. A giant
constrictor snake is wrapped around the crooked branch, its head hanging
within reach, flicking its tongue quickly. A narrow, rocky trail runs
south, leading towards a tight passage up the towering, granite ridge.

    A large intersection of trampled dirt paths lies under a lush canopy of
tall maples, arching oaks, and a few scattered pine trees. Small river
pebbles are imbedded in the dirt path, compressed some time ago when the
trail was muddied after a hard rain. Small patches of tall wild grass bend
over the edges of the winding trail, peppered with exotic wild flowers. The
white painted stones of the tribal ring barely show through the dense wall
of foliage to the west. The main trail skirts the perimeter of the forest
village, winding to the north and south. Another path leads east, narrower
than the rest, through a tunnel of overhanging branches, leading to a
large, domed hut resting under a magnificent oak.

[36mA Path Through the Village[0;37m
    A narrow dirt path rounds the northeastern corner of the quaint elven
village. A large, black snake slithers quickly across the trail,
disappearing in a thick maze of tangled green ivy. Several small mud huts
are scattered deeper in the forest, lying in the shade of massive oak
trees. The forest terrain grows denser traveling west on the narrow dirt
path, where a large, strange hut rests under the twisted branches of a
moss-covered tree. A tall oak rises near the bend in the path, and a small
platform is barely visible through the thick green foliage. A small rope
ladder is coiled at the base of the platform, far out of reach.
Occasionally, the rustling of leaves above betray the presence of an elven
sentry watching from above. To the southwest, large white stone are stacked
neatly three feet tall and form the outer perimeter of the tribe's
ceremonial ring. In the distance, the melodic voices of elven children
giggling echo through the tranquil forest.

    The lush forest terrain grows denser in this small section of the
valley. Tall briar and creepers encroach upon the narrow dirt trail, almost
grabbing at the feet of those that walk too close to the trail's edge. A
large huts sits alone within a small grove in the thick vegetation. The
large hut is is more rectangular in structure and leans awkwardly to one
side, propped against the base of a tall, gnarled tree. Long strands of
green moss hang from the the tree's thick, twisting branches, draping over
the damaged thatch roof. A giant, black kettle boils nearby, emitting dark
smoke and a pungent odor. Two large poles are staked into the grass on both
sides of the hut's entrance, each with detailed carvings and colorful
feathers. Small, colorful bead strands hang from the huts open flap,
allowing a minimal view of the fur-lined interior. A smaller path breaks
from the main trail and leads south to the tribal ring, marking the center
of the elven village. The main trail continues trough the dense forest to
the east and west.

giggling echo through the tranquil forest.

    A large, domed dwelling rests under a giant oak near the eastern edge
of the Kagonesti village. A circle grove of oaks wraps around the elven
hut, giving the hut a secluded forest location. The large hut is supported
by long, arching poles lashed together with rope. The hut's walls are
fashioned from several large animal skins pieced together. Several kettles
varying in shapes, color, and sizes line the perimeter of the old hut.
Although surrounded in natural beauty, the smell of urine and pungent fumes
are nearly overwhelming. No doubt the village has pushed the leather maker
as far to the perimeter of the village as possible to mitigate the elf's
foul curing brews. Narrow paths snake through the forest to the west and
south under the thick tree canopy.

scampers away, leaving a trail of berries on the dirt path. Seizing the

disappearing in a thick maze of tangled green ivy. Several small mud huts
are scattered deeper in the forest, lying in the shade of massive oak
trees. The forest terrain grows denser traveling west on the narrow dirt
path, where a large, strange hut rests under the twisted branches of a
moss-covered tree. A tall oak rises near the bend in the path, and a small
platform is barely visible through the thick green foliage. A small rope
ladder is coiled at the base of the platform, far out of reach.
Occasionally, the rustling of leaves above betray the presence of an elven
sentry watching from above. To the southwest, large white stone are stacked
neatly three feet tall and form the outer perimeter of the tribe's
ceremonial ring. In the distance, the melodic voices of elven children
giggling echo through the tranquil forest.

grabbing at the feet of those that walk too close to the trail's edge. A

large hut is is more rectangular in structure and leans awkwardly to one
side, propped against the base of a tall, gnarled tree. Long strands of
green moss hang from the the tree's thick, twisting branches, draping over
the damaged thatch roof. A giant, black kettle boils nearby, emitting dark
smoke and a pungent odor. Two large poles are staked into the grass on both
sides of the hut's entrance, each with detailed carvings and colorful
feathers. Small, colorful bead strands hang from the huts open flap,
allowing a minimal view of the fur-lined interior. A smaller path breaks
from the main trail and leads south to the tribal ring, marking the center

with small, red berries line the sides of the trail. The sweet sound of
innocent laughter emanates from a cluster of elven girls playing further
down the forest trail. A lanky, scruffy elven lad balances on the white
stones of the ceremonial ring, pretending to navigate a narrow branch high
in the treetops. Leather-bound structures are scattered in the tree line,
blending seamlessly with the brown tapestry of the dense, wooded forest.
High above the curving trail, a watch stand is perched in a sprawling oak,
overlooking the northwest corner of the quaint elven village. Large knots
and low hanging branches make the large oak quite easy to scale, even for
an unseasoned climber. The narrow dirt path bends to the south and east,

    The bough of this vallenwood narrows as it extends further south. A
school for budding warriors lies to the west while a clearing on a junction
of boughs can be seen to the east. You have a strange feeling that you are
being watched especially since the thick vallenwood canopy provides
excellent hiding spots for those skilled in being unseen. The trunk of this
massive vallenwood lies back to the north, and can be reached easily by the
footholds and handholds in the bough leading down.

walk across side by side. You notice a small temple to the east with scores
of people moving in and out, heads bowed. to the west, devout knights seek
solace and divine intervention in a shrine built into a branch. To the
south the bough climbs upward at forty-five degrees, but footholds and
handholds allow for easy progress upwards.

    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    The road travels through the mountains, this is the western edge of the
Kharolis mountains. The air is thin here and you have to gasp for breath to
keep on moving. You don't see much vegetation around, as you would expect

remove this pass from Krynn. Rocks are strewn about, they appear to have
fallen off of the mountains on both sides of you.

minimal. To the south, a small path between the keep and some boulders back
towards the main gate of the keep. Off to the west, a small ledge winds its
way between the keep walls and a sheer drop-off. It might be safe to go
that way, but you wonder if you should risk it. To the east, the winding
road leads down the mountain.

    Before you stand two huge brass gates which once guarded the entrance
to Thorbardin. However, a terrible earthquake has caused the passageway
beyond the gates to collapse, sealing off the entrance forever. The giant
gates have fallen off their hinges and lean forlornly against the piles of
rubble. Although the passage into the kingdom is destroyed, the indomitable
mountain known as Cloudseeker still stands, reaching towards the sky. To
the north and south, narrow paths lead around the cliffs surrounding the
mountain, and a sloping path to the east leads back down the mountain.

thankfully don't look like there will be an avalanche. To the north, the

the tight passageway continues through the barren mountain range.

    The ground here at the foot of the mountain is unnaturally smooth,
almost as if the rock was hewn flat to ease the passage of trade carts. Of
course, there are no cart marks and few bootprints, so perhaps it's just
nature playing tricks on the mind. The unusually flat ground continues and
expands to the west, while a narrow gap between the giant boulders off to
the south allows relatively easy movement in that direction.

    The ground here at the foot of the huge mountain is unnaturally smooth,
almost as if the granite was hewn flat to create a plaza where trade carts
could gather at the foot of the biggest mountain in the region. Of course,
there are no cart marks and few bootprints, even if the smooth area seems
unnaturally wide and the cliff formed by the mountain meeting the ground is
perfectly vertical. The unusually flat ground narrows a bit as it continues
to the east and west from here, flanked by an impervious wall of boulders.

The whole mountain shakes as a hidden mechanism roars to life. Suddenly,
the cliff starts to move, slowly swinging open to reveal an enormous hole

    A row of heavy fortifications are arranged facing the southern wall,
designed to protect dwarven warriors in case invaders are somehow able to
break through the giant stone plug known as Southgate. Any invading forces
resilient enough to make it past the first line of defenses will be forced
to suddenly turn right, which makes fighting very awkward for right-handed
fighters, to ascend the huge spiral ramp that leads into Thorbardin.

    Smoke and soot belch out of the enormous machine that dominates this
cavern. The machine is a marvel of dwarven engineering, and it drives a
cart and track system for efficiently moving people and goods throughout
the kingdom of Thorbardin. According to a sign carved on the wall, this
station provides transit to the south, following the Fourteenth Road.

    Except for a few snoring gully dwarves napping the among rotting crates
on the east side of the wharf the area is deserted. A purple miasma hangs
over the mound of broken crates, but abruptly stops--almost as if a divine
power erected an invisible wall to block the stench. Contrasting the filthy
east, a broad tunnel opens to the south. A large winch system sits upon
the rocky shore, and thick cables stretch across the Urkhan Sea to guide 
mechanized ferries over the lapping water. The sign here says that ferries 
will take passengers to the Life Tree at the center of the Urkhan Sea.

to the point that it seems like it might fall over at any time. In fact,
the only thing that seems to be keeping it standing is the immense pile of
garbage heaped against it. A purple miasma of disgusting odors hangs over
the garbage, ready to suffocate anyone who gets too close. A crude sign on
the wall says that this is the entrance to Agharbardin, as if that wasn't
obvious. A wharf lies to the west, and a cart station to the east.

    The large gate to the south is made of tin and looks extremely flimsy,
to the point that it seems like it might fall over at any time. In fact,
the only thing that seems to be keeping it standing is the immense pile of
garbage heaped against it. A purple miasma of disgusting odors hangs over
the garbage, ready to suffocate anyone who gets too close. A crude sign on
the wall says that this is the entrance to Agharbardin, as if that wasn't
obvious. A wharf lies to the west, and a cart station to the east.

    Except for a few snoring gully dwarves napping the among rotting crates
on the east side of the wharf the area is deserted. A purple miasma hangs
over the mound of broken crates, but abruptly stops--almost as if a divine
power erected an invisible wall to block the stench. Contrasting the filthy
east, a broad tunnel opens to the south. A large winch system sits upon
the rocky shore, and thick cables stretch across the Urkhan Sea to guide 
mechanized ferries over the lapping water. The sign here says that ferries 
will take passengers to the Life Tree at the center of the Urkhan Sea.

    Built on the limestone island beneath the Life Tree at the center of
Thorbardin, these docks bustle with activity as dwarves from every clan
pass through on the way to the taverns, forges, and shops housed within. A
large winch system sits upon the rocky shore, and thick cables stretch off
across the Urkhan Sea to guide the mechanized ferries over the water. The

will deposit passengers near the cities of Agharbardin and Daerbardin.

[36mThe Base of the Life Tree[0;37m
    The gigantic stalactite known as the Life Tree of the Hylar soars up
from here, widening gradually as it rises towards the shadowy ceiling far
above the Urkhan Sea. The outer surface of the stalactite is covered with
an unusual, iridescent coral which casts a warm light that illuminates the
vast cavern surrounding it. Here at its base, the magnificent stalactite
tapers until it is only as wide around as a dwarven waist where it merges
with the limestone island beneath it. A trio of vertical transport shafts
cut through the center of the Life Tree, and the screeching pulleys of the
steam-powered lifts drown out the sounds coming from the nearby docks.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone

the big chains in the transport shafts, but almost none of them bother to
stop on this level. The high ceiling and the archways leading away from
the station are unusually tall for dwarven architecture, as if this area
is designed to accommodate the needs of bigger races. Sturdy wooden boards
block movement through the archways in all directions except north.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a dwarf steps off on
this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must
have fallen off contraptions being transported to other parts of the huge
mountain kingdom. Unlike gnomish parts, these spare parts are as finely
made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and many stop on this level to deposit
dwarves. The boisterous voices of haggling merchants drift in through the
magnificent archway to the west, interrupted only by the occasional clink
of steel coins being dropped into strongboxes. In contrast, there is only
silence beyond the sturdy archway that leads off to the east.

    This large square has been carefully carved out of the limestone, and
it was once a beautiful testament to dwarven stonework. Now, however, the
scratched stone floor is littered with loose gears, broken tools, random
screws and half-finished contraptions. The famed Hylar engineers must work
in the nearby buildings, perfecting the technology that the dwarves use to
defend their mountain home and keep their mighty kingdom running.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone

the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a dwarf steps off on
this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must
have fallen off contraptions being transported to other parts of the huge
mountain kingdom. Unlike gnomish parts, these spare parts are as finely
made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

    The most remarkable thing about this homey square is its incredible
unremarkableness. It is just another place where a bunch of dwarven homes
are gathered, creating a safe place for children to play. The home to the
west has been shuttered up, but those to the north and south are clearly
lived in. The great lifts lie back to the east from here.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and almost every single one stops on
this level to drop off a few gruff dwarven commoners. The area is fairly
clean except for some small piles of refuse, as if the garbage collectors
don't come by frequently enough. All of the massive stone archways leading
away from the lift station are plain and unadorned, but the archway to the
south appears to have been recently and permanently boarded up.

the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a lift stops on this
level so that a well-dressed dwarf or two can step off. The station walls
are lined with platinum and gold panels, suggesting that the dwarves who
live here must be among the wealthiest in Thorbardin. Elaborate carvings
adorn the impressive doors set in the magnificent archways to the east and
south, while the door to the west has been permanently welded shut.

    A shocking amount of gold and platinum has been used in decorating
this antechamber, which has been designed to shock and awe visitors. The
ostentatious furnishings amplify the light from the two glow worms napping
on the ceiling until it's almost blinding. The grand hall of this opulent
home lies to the east, while the exit is guarded by a gilded door.

[36mAn Ostentatious Grand Hall[0;37m
    While this enormous grand hall is only slightly less gilded than the
antechamber before it, it is still more opulently decorated than most royal
palaces elsewhere in the world. The owner's taste for platinum and gold is
again on display, this time tempered with mahogany accents that make the
room less blinding to stand in. Besides the antechamber to the west, the
only other exit is a small platinum door on the north side of the hall. It
seems like the owner of this home ran out of money, since there aren't any
doors in the doorways in the gilded walls to the east and south.

    In stark contrast to the excessive opulence of the rest of the home,
this bedroom is both plain and incomplete. The walls are half-painted with
golden veneer, the dresser and chairs are made from cheap pine wood and
the floor is covered with a bedroll instead of a rug. The only furniture
that remotely exudes wealth is the golden four-post bed, but three of the
posts are unfinished. It's as if the owner of the home ran out of money.

[36mAn Ostentatious Grand Hall[0;37m
    While this enormous grand hall is only slightly less gilded than the
antechamber before it, it is still more opulently decorated than most royal
palaces elsewhere in the world. The owner's taste for platinum and gold is
again on display, this time tempered with mahogany accents that make the
room less blinding to stand in. Besides the antechamber to the west, the
only other exit is a small platinum door on the north side of the hall. It
seems like the owner of this home ran out of money, since there aren't any
doors in the doorways in the gilded walls to the east and south.

the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a lift stops on this
level so that a well-dressed dwarf or two can step off. The station walls
are lined with platinum and gold panels, suggesting that the dwarves who
live here must be among the wealthiest in Thorbardin. Elaborate carvings
adorn the impressive doors set in the magnificent archways to the east and

again on display, this time tempered with mahogany accents that make the
room less blinding to stand in. Besides the antechamber to the west, the
only other exit is a small platinum door on the north side of the hall. It
seems like the owner of this home ran out of money, since there aren't any
doors in the doorways in the gilded walls to the east and south.

    A shocking amount of gold and platinum has been used in decorating
this antechamber, which has been designed to shock and awe visitors. The
ostentatious furnishings amplify the light from the two glow worms napping
on the ceiling until it's almost blinding. The grand hall of this opulent

the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a lift stops on this
