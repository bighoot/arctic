    The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace dominates
one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill the
room. A stairway leads up, further into the tree, while another stairway
leads down to the forest below.

    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

[36mNorthern Avenue[0;37m
    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

[36mA Forgotten Conclave Dungeon[0;37m
     This small disgusting cell contains deplorable living conditions and
general squalor. The blackened walls are scratched with innumerable hash
marks that look to have been used as markers to count the passing days,
months or years that the previous inhabitants were stored in this, the most
meager of accommodations.  A small bucket sits in the corner of the room and
a pile of straw has been stacked to serve as a bed. Several bones litter
the floor of this tiny cell turned tomb. The air is stagnant and makes you
gasp for fresh air.

[36mThe Dungeon Corridor[0;37m
     The dimly lit corridor you now stand in overpowers the senses with the
smell of decay and death.  The guards that once roamed these halls didn't
make it out alive either, evident by the piles of bones and gnawed and
destroyed uniforms on the floor.  A small chair with a skeletal corpse still
sitting vigilantly occupies the area in between the cells to the north and
south. A small book sits under the skeletal figure sitting in the chair.

You pick up the book and flip through some of the ancient pages, expecting
to find some insight into escaping this dungeon. However, you are
disappointed when you learn that the book is mostly about the forbidden
love of a gnome and a dwarf. The book is extremely romantic and quickly
bores you. The covers and most of the pages have been chewed and gnawed on.
There are some rat droppings stuck between several of the pages.

    The rats that cover most of the floor crunch beneath your feet. It's a
grotesque sight to see so many rodents covering the floor and not making an
effort to move out of your way. This small corridor of the dungeon is
completely empty.  The hallway bends towards a lone ominous cell.

[36mA Makeshift Library[0;37m
    This small library has clearly been recently constructed. Books line
the makeshift wooden shelving on the walls and the only light in this dark
place emanates from a small wax candle on the table that rests in the
corner of the room. The opposite corner houses a small bed which looks to
have been recently used, as it has not been made. Dark and arcane drawings
are scrawled onto the walls of the room along with many incantations you
have yet to see while practicing the art of magic. You get a sense of chaos
and madness from looking at the haphazardly drawn pictures, no thought or
reason looks to have been put into them. Under most of the drawings is
gibberish that you can scarcely understand.

As you move to smash the replica, the nearby statues infuse your fist with
their elemental powers. With a swift strike, your fist smashes through the
fragile glass replica, shattering it into a million pieces.

As you pull back from delivering that mighty blow, the replica of a
prisoner quickly grows from a tiny figurine into an angry elven mage!

The mage points his slender finger at you and grunts a word of command,
drawing the elemental power out of you and forms a floating ball of energy
from it. The ball of energy hovers protectively near the elven mage.

smooth walls appear to be chiseled out of the stone perfectly, no markings
of a pick or tool of any sort. Sconces line the walls, lit with a fire that
doesn't seem to produce any heat. The floor is made of a marble stone like
material, the flame dancing from it's surface. There is a small ring-like
hole in the floor near the center of the room. The only way out is back the

The death cry of a renegade mage echoes from somewhere nearby...

As the elven renegade falls, a voice echoes in your mind:

    'Your have done well, and your Test is complete. Choose the path you
     wish to follow: white, red or black.'

A portal flashes into existence.

    The entire spire seems to be forged from a single gargantuan piece of
obsidian. Polished obsidian steps extrude from the walls and climb in a

through the area, the steps remain unblemished. From a landing on the
northern wall, a small doorway opens into a small chamber.

    The entrance to the western spire is bound on all sides by glossy
obsidian. The walls shimmer with iridescent light from prismatic spheres
that float aimlessly through the air. The absence of any furniture suggests
that no one lingers here for very long. A precarious obsidian staircase
begins on the western wall and spirals up around the room.

    Blocks of obsidian stone form a triangular wall around the perimeter of
the Tower of Wayreth which lead their way to a set of delicately forged
gates set before you. The beautiful structure seems to be more of an art
form rather than an extreme measure of earthly protection likely useless to
the powerful mages who defend Wayreth. The magical forest is a short

a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and

foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. There is always someone

Numerous tents of varying sizes can be seen in all directions. While on the
surface this village appears to be somewhat permanent, closer inspection
reveals that if desired the Que-teh could easily break camp and move to a
more fertile landscape. To the north lies the exit to Que-teh village,
while to the east and west a circular path winds through the village.

trimmed furs of numerous beasts serve as carpeting for this quaint little
room. The lighting is provided by small, rustic lanterns hung upon each of
the tent's four main support poles. The central support pole is rather
large and carved with intricate runes from top to bottom, portraying the
hunt of some great, mystical beast. A bedroll rests on the floor of the
southeast corner of the tent, surrounded by books. Stacks of books and
tanned hides with spell components laid out on them occupy the rest of the
room.

    This well-trod path through Que-teh Village allows easy access to the
few larger and more populated tents of the encampment. It also provides the
major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. There is always someone
wandering around this path, be it the occasional farmer or group of
children playing contentedly. However, the threat of the dragonarmy looms
over the village at all times, and there is an underlying air of constant
alert.

    The path winds through a few smaller tents here, most of which have
small cooking fires near their entrance. All around you see plainsmen going
about their daily lives, grinding corn, sharpening arrowheads, or cooking
the family meal are just a few of the chores being performed. The path
continues east and west here.

    As you step past the first few tents, Que-teh village takes form.
Numerous tents of varying sizes can be seen in all directions. While on the
surface this village appears to be somewhat permanent, closer inspection
reveals that if desired the Que-teh could easily break camp and move to a
more fertile landscape. To the north lies the exit to Que-teh village,
while to the east and west a circular path winds through the village.

    The social and religious center of the Que-teh tribe, this fire pit is
almost always surrounded by plainsmen. Small stumps have been set up near
the fire to allow places to sit when eating or chatting with a friend. As
you stare into the fire, a feeling of peace and wellbeing washes over you.
There appears to be some sort of meeting going on around the fire pit.

    As you step past the first few tents, Que-teh village takes form.
Numerous tents of varying sizes can be seen in all directions. While on the
surface this village appears to be somewhat permanent, closer inspection
reveals that if desired the Que-teh could easily break camp and move to a
more fertile landscape. To the north lies the exit to Que-teh village,
while to the east and west a circular path winds through the village.

large and carved with intricate runes from top to bottom, portraying the
hunt of some great, mystical beast. A bedroll rests on the floor of the
southeast corner of the tent, surrounded by books. Stacks of books and
tanned hides with spell components laid out on them occupy the rest of the

    This well-trod path through Que-teh Village allows easy access to the
few larger and more populated tents of the encampment. It also provides the
major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. There is always someone
wandering around this path, be it the occasional farmer or group of
children playing contentedly. However, the threat of the dragonarmy looms
over the village at all times, and there is an underlying air of constant
alert.

    The path winds through a few smaller tents here, most of which have
small cooking fires near their entrance. All around you see plainsmen going
about their daily lives, grinding corn, sharpening arrowheads, or cooking
the family meal are just a few of the chores being performed. The path
continues east and west here.

    As you step past the first few tents, Que-teh village takes form.
Numerous tents of varying sizes can be seen in all directions. While on the
surface this village appears to be somewhat permanent, closer inspection
reveals that if desired the Que-teh could easily break camp and move to a
more fertile landscape. To the north lies the exit to Que-teh village,
while to the east and west a circular path winds through the village.

tower through the flagstone courtyard of the Tower of High Sorcery. The
black obsidian walls, which surround the perimeter of the towers ground,
seem to lie much further away than what you perceived from outside the

discussing the many details of the Conclave and the magic it protects. The
delicate gates of the tower lie to the south past a beautiful crystal
fountain, while a small foretower placed between the two obsidian spires is

    The dense forest around you occasionally places obstacles in your path,
you cannot help but trip and fall. Fortunately the soft cushion of dead
leaves offers much help. Weak sounds of the hustle and bustle of town life
can be heard from the north. The road continues to the south, it seems as
if it could go on forever.

    The trees that line the route give a good indication of the ways to
travel. To the north the huge vallenwood trees of Solace are visible,
clearly marking the southern entrance to the town. The road to the south
becomes wild and rocky as it leads through a wilder section of forest.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the south. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and the gate is placed
between them. The forest to the south looks much wilder and more dangerous
than the forest that houses Solace. Southern Avenue leads north into
Solace itself.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their

here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

school for budding warriors lies to the west while a clearing on a junction
of boughs can be seen to the east. You have a strange feeling that you are

excellent hiding spots for those skilled in being unseen. The trunk of this
massive vallenwood lies back to the north, and can be reached easily by the
footholds and handholds in the bough leading down.

the west before ending at high, jagged cliffs. The forest of pine that this
trail winds through thins out to the north and east, where large fields of
grain can be seen. The pine-covered trail follows the shoreline to the
south into thicker woods and north.

    Weaving its way around a corner of the lake, this small trail runs
between Crystalmir and a dense forest of pine. Squirrels chatter as they
dart from tree to tree in a frenetic chase, startling a red-headed
woodpecker into flight. The sunlight trickles through the forest of dense
evergreens, which cover the ground to the south and east. To the north and
west the sandy trail continues along the shoreline.

    The narrow trail rounds a corner here to avoid running into Crystalmir
Lake, which juts into the land at the north and stretches out far to the
west. The sun glints off the water, which ripples slightly as a pleasant
wind blows across it. Nattering squirrels can be heard in the forest of
pine stretching out to the southeast, beyond which the sounds of
civilization rise from the village of Solace. As the trail follows the
curve of the lake it heads south along the shoreline, and to the east where
it rounds another bend.

and sturdy. Large enough for passage of two wagons side by side, the bridge
barely feels the affects of the wind and water. A dwelling can be seen off
to north on a small island, nestled into a massive vallenwood tree. South
of here lies the shores of lake Crystalmir.

[36mThe Grand Foyer[0;37m
    An architectural masterpiece, the grand foyer exudes opulence in every
detail. Matthias spared no expense importing marble floors from the region
around his native Palanthas. Lovely tapestries adorn the walls emblazoned
with crests of Palanthinian nobility. A beautiful fresco plasters the
ceiling depicting Huma's sacrifice in the third dragon war. Large stained
glass windows checker the western wall casting colored shadows on the
marble. Servants scurry to the north while the changing of the guard can be
seen to the south. A large arch to the east leads further into the mansion.

    An architectural masterpiece, the grand foyer exudes opulence in every

around his native Palanthas. Lovely tapestries adorn the walls emblazoned
with crests of Palanthinian nobility. A beautiful fresco plasters the
ceiling depicting Huma's sacrifice in the third dragon war. Large stained
glass windows checker the western wall casting colored shadows on the
marble. Servants scurry to the north while the changing of the guard can be
seen to the south. A large arch to the east leads further into the mansion.

    An architectural masterpiece, the grand foyer exudes opulence in every

around his native Palanthas. Lovely tapestries adorn the walls emblazoned
with crests of Palanthinian nobility. A beautiful fresco plasters the
ceiling depicting Huma's sacrifice in the third dragon war. Large stained
glass windows checker the western wall casting colored shadows on the
marble. Servants scurry to the north while the changing of the guard can be

of boughs can be seen to the east. You have a strange feeling that you are
being watched especially since the thick vallenwood canopy provides
excellent hiding spots for those skilled in being unseen. The trunk of this
massive vallenwood lies back to the north, and can be reached easily by the
footholds and handholds in the bough leading down.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
