                         Happy New Year!

Several code bugs have been addressed:

 * Thieves can no longer backstab with lances.
 * Shamans can brew while standing in their guild, similar to other
   classes.
 * The reincarnation menu text is updated for current times.
 * 'Sap strength' no longer displays the victim name to the victim.
 * 'Legendary Gore' fumble chance has increased significantly. (We may need
   to readjust the chance, pending further testing and player feedback.)
 * All fooms from this wipe are debugged and fixed.

Many items remain on our list, especially 'creation' (zone) issues for
newer content. Please continue to report obvious issues with the 'bug'
command and we'll fix things as we have time.

    The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace dominates
one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill the

    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

cleared by recent rainfall.

[36mForest Lane[0;37m
    Forest Lane winds in among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and turns
sharply as you wander through the forest. The canopy overhead is quite
thick. You hear sounds of wildlife all around you. You notice a small path
leading south from here. Forest Lane itself leads west and east.

[36mThe Solace Dump[0;37m
    This is the Solace Dump. It is basically a huge sinkhole which is
filled with trash and other odds and ends. The smell is quite horrible. The
thick foliage around the edge of the dump is effective in keeping the smell
and sight of the dump isolated from the rest of Solace. A small path leads
north. A large sewer grate, which is perpetually open, allows access to the
sewers below.

[36mOn a Road[0;37m
    The road continues, snaking through the rocky wilderness. It makes a
large curve to avoid a big boulder, jutting out from the surrounding hills.
You have heard tales of bandits surviving off of travellers on the roadways
of Krynn, and it occurs to you that this would be an excellent spot for an
ambush. The road continues to the north and south.

    Wearily, you come to stop outside a small hovel. It looks like it has
been built as a rest stop to provide a safe haven for travellers. The hovel
sits off to the west of the main road here. The road itself stretches out
to the north and east. The terrain to the east becomes dry and dusty,
while you can see what appears to be a forest on the edge of the plains to
the north.

to be getting drier and dustier, and there are fewer trees. In addition,
the air seems to be getting somewhat colder. From a nearby hill, a deer
notices you, and bolts into the woods. From here, the road continues to the

    Around you are the plains of Abanasinia. The land is very flat and you
can see for miles and miles around. A few trees are growing here and there,
along with other kinds of short vegetation bushes, brush and other assorted
plants. In the distant west you can see a mountain range and a cool breeze
is blowing in from the east. Looking to the east you can see the lands of
the Que-teh tribe, their cooking fires trailing smoke up into the sky.

large and carved with intricate runes from top to bottom, portraying the

    This is a small tavern but filled to the brim with rowdy customers that
are both loud and drunk. Stale ale and bowls of musty broth are served by a
couple of wenches, occasionally having to fend off a few wandering hands. A
small fireplace lies in the north wall providing little light as most of
the corners of the tavern are shrouded in darkness.

in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and

partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    At this bend in the sewer tunnels, passage to the north and west is
possible. The dark tunnels appear to go on forever and stagnant air makes
it difficult to breath. The area appears well-travelled, though, so as
difficult as breath is to come by, the conditions must be far from deadly.

combination of scratching, rustling, skittering and dripping noises can be
heard. The air remains fetid and feculent without significant airflow to
clear the area. Small puddles of water checker the floor with an occasional
drop from the ceiling adding to the cacophony of the tunnel.

    This is a small tavern but filled to the brim with rowdy customers that
are both loud and drunk. Stale ale and bowls of musty broth are served by a
couple of wenches, occasionally having to fend off a few wandering hands. A
small fireplace lies in the north wall providing little light as most of
the corners of the tavern are shrouded in darkness.

    Echoes bounce off the tunnel walls from indiscernible directions. A
combination of scratching, rustling, skittering and dripping noises can be
heard. The air remains fetid and feculent without significant airflow to
clear the area. Small puddles of water checker the floor with an occasional
drop from the ceiling adding to the cacophony of the tunnel.

    This is a small tavern but filled to the brim with rowdy customers that
are both loud and drunk. Stale ale and bowls of musty broth are served by a
couple of wenches, occasionally having to fend off a few wandering hands. A
small fireplace lies in the north wall providing little light as most of
the corners of the tavern are shrouded in darkness.

[36mThe Solace Dump[0;37m
    This is the Solace Dump. It is basically a huge sinkhole which is
filled with trash and other odds and ends. The smell is quite horrible. The
thick foliage around the edge of the dump is effective in keeping the smell
and sight of the dump isolated from the rest of Solace. A small path leads
north. A large sewer grate, which is perpetually open, allows access to the
sewers below.

[36mUnder a Sewer Grate[0;37m
    The tunnel ends here. Moisture permeates the area. The stench of the
sewer is less potent here and a small breeze can be felt from above. Small
puddles of water have been formed near the wall of the tunnel where
partially rusted iron rungs have been embedded into the wall. Although wet
and rusty the rungs appear sturdy enough to bear the weight of even the
largest individual. The stench of the sewer appears stronger to the east.

    The tunnel ends here. Moisture permeates the area. The stench of the
sewer is less potent here and a small breeze can be felt from above. Small
puddles of water have been formed near the wall of the tunnel where
partially rusted iron rungs have been embedded into the wall. Although wet
and rusty the rungs appear sturdy enough to bear the weight of even the
largest individual. The stench of the sewer appears stronger to the east.

[36mThe Intersection[0;37m
    You are at a huge intersection in the forest. Southern Avenue meets
with Park Road and Forest Lane here. There is a small opening in the trees
above that allows a view of the sky above. A small breeze blows through
here and you inhale deeply. Southern Avenue leads north and south from the
intersection, while Forest Lane leads off west and Park Road exits to the
east.

[36mSouthern Avenue[0;37m
    You are on a rather wide road. This avenue leads south and north
through the town. To the north, you see buildings built up in the limbs of
the huge vallenwoods. This view of Solace shows you how much the village
depends on the ancient trees for life and sustenance. The avenue leads
north and south.

[36mSouthern Avenue[0;37m
    The avenue leads north and south through the huge vallenwoods. The
trees loom high above you. Their limbs form a canopy that protects you from
the harsh outside world. The forest here teems with life. You notice a
smaller road leading east into what appears to be a park.

[36mThe Southern Gate of Solace[0;37m
    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the south. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and the gate is placed
between them. The forest to the south looks much wilder and more dangerous
than the forest that houses Solace. Southern Avenue leads north into
Solace itself.
