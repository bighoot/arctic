Welcome to the land of Krynn.

[35mThe Inn of Myth[0;37m
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a

near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves

Torak is a huge dwarf. His long red beard flows all the way down to his lap.
You notice he is playing with it absent-mindedly. He is dressed in rich robes
and armor. Even though he is old and wise, he is still a match for any hardy
adventurer.
Torak is in an excellent condition.

scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel

    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

[36mBefore an Old Cemetery[0;37m
    To the north stands a rusty bronze gate, hanging slightly off its
hinges. Stretching to either side of it stands an old rickety fence
surrounding what appears to be a graveyard. To the east the trail leads to
the western city gates of Kalaman, to the west it leads deeper into the
fields, and toward the river.

[36mBeyond the City of Kalaman[0;37m
    Just beyond the western gates of Kalaman, the trail splits into two
paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off to
the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.

[36mAn Intersection in the Road[0;37m
    The long road seems to go on forever as you see it continue to the
north and south from here. The plains surround you in every direction. The
city of Kalaman lies somewhere to the north, while foothills begin to take
form just off to your south. Leading off the road to the east, you also
notice a small path. A small sign has been nailed to a tree here.

rolling foothills springing up to your south. The road continues to your

    You find yourself nearing the fortified village of Telvan. It sits off
to the northeast of the road, with the dark red banners of the Red
Dragonarmy flying prominently above the battlements. The roadway cuts
beside it to the north, and continues east into the foothills skirting the
Khalkist mountains.

Jelek sprawls out in its disgusting filth. The tents of slavers can be seen
cresting over the low protective wall that encircles the town. Nestled
close to the black beast of the Khalkists, the town looks truly fitting in
such a dark place. The road leads off to the north, leading through the
badlands. The mountains rise high above eastwards.

towards the peaks of the Khalkists. Out to the west, the foothills cover
the badlands, leaving no sign of habitation in their midst.

[36mBefore the City of Neraka[0;37m
    The dark city of Neraka spreads out to the south, the dark minions of
Takhisis filling the streets. A twisted dark spire rises in the middle of
the city, the pinnacle of the Queen's temple. The craggy peaks of the
Khalkist mountains rise around the city, adding their shadows to the film
of ash that floats through the air.

[36mA Cobbled Path[0;37m
    Cowering in the shadows of the black city walls, this cobbled path is
almost completely lost in shadow. The roughly hewn cobbles are covered with
filth and trash, and the path probably hasn't been cleaned in months. More
care has been taken in hewing the stones used to make the massive walls,
clearly showing where the city's priorities lie. A dreary gloom hangs over
the area, and it would be unwise to linger here longer than necessary. The
dirty cobblestone path continues to the east and west, while an ominously
narrow passage between the looming walls leads to the south from here. Off
to the north, a rocky path leads into the mighty Khalkist mountains.

[36mThe Main Gates of Neraka[0;37m
    The ominous black stones of the city walls press in close, creating a
killing zone in front of the terrifying main gates of Neraka. The gates are
forged from solid steel and adorned with stylized golden sculptures of the
Dark Queen -- as the warrior and as the seductress. The massive gates stand
guard beneath a foreboding archway, and a life-like stone sculpture of the
five-headed dragon perches protectively over the gates. The dragon's heads
seem to be moving, but that is probably just a trick of the shadows.

[36mThe Emperor's Court[0;37m
    Opulent black and gold pennants hang from the stone walls surrounding
this ominous courtyard. A golden throne sits upon a dais at the eastern end
of the courtyard, and there is enough space for a couple hundred troops to
line up before it. The ostentatious decorations have clearly been designed
to instill visitors with a sense of awe, but everything looks a bit small,
as if the architect was told to exercise moderation and didn't know how. A
pair of cruel black gates stand at the northern end of the courtyard, while
a spacious stone passageway leads off to the south. Beyond the west end of
the courtyard lies a broad lane and the dolorous milieu of the dark city.

[36mA Spacious Stone Passageway[0;37m
    Formed from gigantic blocks of black granite, this spacious passageway
is wide enough across for twenty men to walk abreast. The giant stones arch
high overhead, yet the space feels somewhat claustrophobic. The passageway
acts as a link between courtyards to the north and south, and from here it
is obvious that the Emperor's Court to the north is gaudier, but less grand
than the magnificent and terrible Queen's Court that lies to the south.

[36mThe Queen's Court[0;37m
    This vast, open courtyard is large enough to hold thousands of people
and is an excellent place for the dark pilgrims to gather an audience for
mass prayers or public executions. The west end of the court is dominated
by a raised platform where such spectacles can be staged in full view of
the citizenry, and a five-headed dragon has been carved on the wall behind
it. This courtyard somehow manages to be both magnificent and terrible at
the same time. Twisted black gates stand guard to the south while a
spacious stone passageway lies to the north. A wide lane begins at the base
of the platform and leads east into the dismal melee of the city.

    The vaulted ceiling of this antechamber is lined with the angry stone
faces of gargoyles, each more grotesquely twisted than the last. The dark

blasphemers who dare to enter the temple. A dark initiation chamber rests
just beyond an archway at the southern end of the antechamber, while there
appears to be an unholy light radiating through the northern archway. The
whisper of a seductive voice drifts out of the darkness to the west.

[36mThe Audience Hall of Takhisis[0;37m
    The ominous black walls of this vast hall radiate a terrible heat that
makes it difficult to breathe in here. The fetid stench hanging in the air
smells like a toxic mixture of sulfur, chlorine and rust. The surface of
the black granite floor is covered with scuff marks. The crumbling walls
seem to be shifting erratically, almost as if they are not wholly in this
dimension. Five giant alcoves have been cut out of the walls, and each one
is big enough for an ancient dragon to rest comfortably inside. A sweeping
archway on the eastern end of the hall leads to the rest of the temple.

[36mThe Antechamber of the Temple of Takhisis[0;37m
    The vaulted ceiling of this antechamber is lined with the angry stone
faces of gargoyles, each more grotesquely twisted than the last. The dark
statues appear to be reaching out in vain, reaching out to tear apart any
blasphemers who dare to enter the temple. A dark initiation chamber rests
just beyond an archway at the southern end of the antechamber, while there
appears to be an unholy light radiating through the northern archway. The
whisper of a seductive voice drifts out of the darkness to the west.

    The ominous black walls of this vast hall radiate a terrible heat that
makes it difficult to breathe in here. The fetid stench hanging in the air
smells like a toxic mixture of sulfur, chlorine and rust. The surface of
the black granite floor is covered with scuff marks. The crumbling walls

is big enough for an ancient dragon to rest comfortably inside. A sweeping

    The massive square surrounding the towering Temple of Takhisis is paved
with roughly cut slabs of black granite. The dark paving stones are married
by deep claw marks, left by the dragons who parade through the square on
formal occasions. The grotesquely twisted temple rises out of the ground
like a hideous claw trying to rend the sky, and the oppressive shadows cast
by the temple blanket the entire square in perpetual darkness. Some ominous
doors of tainted gold stand here, guarding the entrance to the temple.

[36mA Dimly Lit Chapel[0;37m
    Set apart from the main temple, the crumbling stone walls of this dark
chapel seem to absorb any stray sound. In this deathly quiet sanctuary,
the Dark Queen's most devout clerics come to commune with their goddess,
free of any disturbances from the outside world. The small black shrine at
the north end of the dark chapel glows with an unholy light that makes the
stone walls appear to phase in and out of existence. The rest of the black
temple lies to the south, beyond a narrow archway flanked by gargoyles.

[36mThe Antechamber of the Temple of Takhisis[0;37m
    The vaulted ceiling of this antechamber is lined with the angry stone
faces of gargoyles, each more grotesquely twisted than the last. The dark
statues appear to be reaching out in vain, reaching out to tear apart any
blasphemers who dare to enter the temple. A dark initiation chamber rests
just beyond an archway at the southern end of the antechamber, while there
appears to be an unholy light radiating through the northern archway. The
whisper of a seductive voice drifts out of the darkness to the west.

[36mTemple Square[0;37m
    The massive square surrounding the towering Temple of Takhisis is paved
with roughly cut slabs of black granite. The dark paving stones are married
by deep claw marks, left by the dragons who parade through the square on
formal occasions. The grotesquely twisted temple rises out of the ground
like a hideous claw trying to rend the sky, and the oppressive shadows cast
by the temple blanket the entire square in perpetual darkness. Some ominous
doors of tainted gold stand here, guarding the entrance to the temple.

[36mThe Queen's Court[0;37m
    This vast, open courtyard is large enough to hold thousands of people
and is an excellent place for the dark pilgrims to gather an audience for
mass prayers or public executions. The west end of the court is dominated
by a raised platform where such spectacles can be staged in full view of
the citizenry, and a five-headed dragon has been carved on the wall behind
it. This courtyard somehow manages to be both magnificent and terrible at
the same time. Twisted black gates stand guard to the south while a
spacious stone passageway lies to the north. A wide lane begins at the base
of the platform and leads east into the dismal melee of the city.

by the temple blanket the entire square in perpetual darkness. The twisted

[36mTemple Square[0;37m
    The massive square surrounding the towering Temple of Takhisis is paved
with roughly cut slabs of black granite. The dark paving stones are married
by deep claw marks, left by the dragons who parade through the square on
formal occasions. The grotesquely twisted Temple rises out of the ground
like a hideous claw trying to rend the sky, and the oppressive shadows cast
by the Temple blanket the entire square in perpetual darkness.

[36mThe Queen's Court[0;37m
    This vast, open courtyard is large enough to hold thousands of people
and is an excellent place for the dark pilgrims to gather an audience for
mass prayers or public executions. The west end of the court is dominated
by a raised platform where such spectacles can be staged in full view of
the citizenry, and a five-headed dragon has been carved on the wall behind
it. This courtyard somehow manages to be both magnificent and terrible at
the same time. Twisted black gates stand guard to the south while a
spacious stone passageway lies to the north. A wide lane begins at the base
of the platform and leads east into the dismal melee of the city.

[36mA Spacious Stone Passageway[0;37m
    Formed from gigantic blocks of black granite, this spacious passageway
is wide enough across for twenty men to walk abreast. The giant stones arch
high overhead, yet the space feels somewhat claustrophobic. The passageway
acts as a link between courtyards to the north and south, and from here it
is obvious that the Emperor's Court to the north is gaudier, but less grand
than the magnificent and terrible Queen's Court that lies to the south.

[36mThe Emperor's Court[0;37m
    Opulent black and gold pennants hang from the stone walls surrounding
this ominous courtyard. A golden throne sits upon a dais at the eastern end
of the courtyard, and there is enough space for a couple hundred troops to
line up before it. The ostentatious decorations have clearly been designed
to instill visitors with a sense of awe, but everything looks a bit small,
as if the architect was told to exercise moderation and didn't know how. A
pair of cruel black gates stand at the northern end of the courtyard, while
a spacious stone passageway leads off to the south. Beyond the west end of
the courtyard lies a broad lane and the dolorous milieu of the dark city.

[36mThe Main Gates of Neraka[0;37m
    The ominous black stones of the city walls press in close, creating a
killing zone in front of the terrifying main gates of Neraka. The gates are
forged from solid steel and adorned with stylized golden sculptures of the
Dark Queen -- as the warrior and as the seductress. The massive gates stand
guard beneath a foreboding archway, and a life-like stone sculpture of the
five-headed dragon perches protectively over the gates. The dragon's heads
seem to be moving, but that is probably just a trick of the shadows.

[36mA Cobbled Path[0;37m
    Cowering in the shadows of the black city walls, this cobbled path is
almost completely lost in shadow. The roughly hewn cobbles are covered with
filth and trash, and the path probably hasn't been cleaned in months. More
care has been taken in hewing the stones used to make the massive walls,
clearly showing where the city's priorities lie. A dreary gloom hangs over
the area, and it would be unwise to linger here longer than necessary. The
dirty cobblestone path continues to the east and west, while an ominously
narrow passage between the looming walls leads to the south from here. Off
to the north, a rocky path leads into the mighty Khalkist mountains.

[36mThe Outskirts of the Black Dragonarmy Camp[0;37m
    Cowering in the shadows of the black city walls, this cobbled path is
almost completely lost in shadow. The roughly hewn cobbles are covered with
filth and trash, and the path probably hasn't been cleaned in months. More
care has been taken in hewing the stones used to make the massive walls,
clearly showing where the city's priorities lie. A dreary gloom hangs over
the area, and it would be unwise to linger here longer than necessary. The
dirty cobblestone path continues to the south and west from here. The tall
pennants of the Black Dragonarmy stand on the east side of the path.

    The rocky bend in the mountains is a sort of valley as the taller
mountain peaks all around slope downward. Loose boulders above give an
uneasy feeling, as the mountains funnel to this portion of the road. The
only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs
are unscalable. An indication of civilization comes in the form of a thin
netting that sits along the sloped cliffside to the west, preventing much
of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such
netting to the south.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

towards the coast. Deteriorating from lack of maintenance, the road now has
several weeds growing up through the spaces between the broken stones.

[36mAlong the Coast[0;37m
    At the top of a large outcrop, a small village can be seen in the
distance. The road has very few cracks, and it appears to have been well
maintained over time. It continues to follow the contour of the hilly
landscape and shoreline. There is a small forest full of pine trees growing
over the hills. Sheer cliffs drop off to the coastline below and any
misstep could prove to be fatal.

the Blood Sea. The village of Dragon's Point was built on the tip of a

very pungent. The beginnings of the lush northern forests of the Endscape

    The road passes through the outskirts of Dragon's Point as it heads
deeper into Kern. Now dilapidated and in disrepair, several homes were once
built on the outer pastures. The bustling village only exists because of
the extensive fishing trade from the Blood Sea. It is built on a tip of a
peninsula around a small harbor and cove. Several small fishing boats can
be seen floating in the nearby waters. The air reeks of rotted fish and it
is why many outsiders will not come to visit..

[36mNearing Dragon's Point[0;37m
    To the west the docks of Dragon's Point can be seen, a speck of
civilization amonst the wild grasslands. Pink-white foam spins in
uncontrolled spirals, driven by the waves and the winds whipping from the
sanguine sea, creating fleeting patterns of cerise bubbles. These waters,
poisoned by the death and daring of the Cataclysm, have been stained as red
as blood, with a high salt content which makes it seem almost as thick, as
well. Dyed by the crimson waters, massive colonies of kelp float a few feet
beneath the surface, striped with sable and magenta, appropriately known as
bloodwrack.

[36mAlong the Coast of the Dancing Woods[0;37m
    To the north the tall pines of the Dancing Woods tower over the
Nightmare Sea. Deep beneath the surface of the Blood Sea dark shapes can be
seen flitting perilously among the submerged castles and keeps which once
dotted the Istarian countryside. The waters feel unnaturally thick, like
clotted blood, and the air seems preternaturally humid and heavy, as if the
weight of the souls of those drowned below somehow drags the very ether
downwards. Driven by the sempiternal tempest at the center of the waves,
the winds howl in hideous lament, mourning the wrath of the gods and
weeping at the arrogance of man.

The waters feel unnaturally thick, like clotted blood, and the air seems

lies as the center of the violent sea, thrashing and spinning with barbaric

voracious torque. Glowering with repugnant fury, a gargantuan black cloud
lies in the very middle of the waters, darkening the sherried waves to an

[36mThe Blood Sea[0;37m
    Dyed by the crimson waters, massive colonies of kelp float a few feet
beneath the surface, striped with sable and magenta, appropriately known as
bloodwrack. Deep beneath the surface of the Blood Sea dark shapes can be
seen flitting perilously among the submerged castles and keeps which once
dotted the Istarian countryside. The waters feel unnaturally thick, like
clotted blood, and the air seems preternaturally humid and heavy, as if the
weight of the souls of those drowned below somehow drags the very ether
downwards.

feet above the sea level, giant waves menace any watercraft stupid enough
to brave the doomed sea-lanes, rioting with mindless atrocity against the
autonomy of the gods themselves. Pink-white foam spins in uncontrolled
spirals, driven by the waves and the winds whipping from the sanguine sea,
creating fleeting patterns of cerise bubbles.

    The pull of the waters into the torrential maw of the Maelstrom is
almost impossible to resist. Pink-white foam spins in uncontrolled spirals,
driven by the waves and the winds whipping from the sanguine sea, creating
fleeting patterns of cerise bubbles. These waters, poisoned by the death
and daring of the Cataclysm, have been stained as red as blood, with a high
salt content which makes it seem almost as thick, as well. Dyed by the
crimson waters, massive colonies of kelp float a few feet beneath the
surface, striped with sable and magenta, appropriately known as bloodwrack.

    Brutal tides rip everything to the south, towards the massive hole in
the ocean at the center of the Blood Sea. Deep beneath the surface of the
Blood Sea dark shapes can be seen flitting perilously among the submerged
castles and keeps which once dotted the Istarian countryside. The waters
feel unnaturally thick, like clotted blood, and the air seems
preternaturally humid and heavy, as if the weight of the souls of those
drowned below somehow drags the very ether downwards. Driven by the
sempiternal tempest at the center of the waves, the winds howl in hideous
lament, mourning the wrath of the gods and weeping at the arrogance of man.

So Gor got pinched eh? Blast'd turncoat priests and their laws. You know
'im and me 'ave brought in more heretics for their so-called cleansin' than
any other hunters 'round?" The hunter frowns even harder, and grips his ale
with a pale white hand.

Well, guess that ends this journey then. 'Ere, you might as well take this,
he says, flipping someone a small wooden token. We was on the trail
o' a particularly ornery heretical agitator when Gor went to the jail to
turn in the cow we caught outside a' town. 'Out 'im tho I guess it's kinda
useless. The hunter curses loudly then calms himself and looks at
someone. Well, he's yer problem now. Last snitch we found said
Shadow could be found hereabouts and gave us that token, but damned if'n I
seen 'em. Good luck, he's worth a pretty piece o' steel dead 'er alive."

back down to stare into the fire ... "If'n you do catch 'em, give 'em a
swift one in the ribs for ole' Gor and me."

the blood pool on the floor widens, he glares at you, then runs out the

[36mHumility Lane and Northwest Street Intersection[0;37m
     You stand at a massive intersection in the center of Istar. Indeed a
sense of humility is in order, for directly to the east lies the Temple of
the Gods. Through lawns and gardens you can see the temple clearly from
here, and it's the largest building you ever remember seeing in your
travels. Columns towering easily one hundred times a man's height over the
grounds support the domed roof, and inset behind the fascade seems to be a
golden ziggurat that reaches into the cloudless sky.

     The path slowly ambling through the gardens widens here, and you blink
as, beyond the statuary and fruit-bearing trees, you suddenly see the

immense size of the column-fronted temple. Behind a massive pediment,
spires of pure gold soar into the clouds, and the white marble of the
structure almost seems to glow.

[36mBefore the Temple of the Gods[0;37m
     Reverent awe fills your soul as you stand in front of what once was
the most famous structure on all of Ansalon. Done in pure white marble, the
front part of the temple dwarfs you, blocking any view of the sky. From a
raised platform, ten massive, fluted columns in a perfect row stretch
towards the heavens themselves. Their diameter increases slightly as they
rise, meeting massive scroll-shaped volutes that support a single blank
pediment. Behind the colonnade, two huge golden doors reflect any and all
light, giving the temple the appearance of glowing.

its trunk easily three times your height across. Towering over you its
upper branches extend outward from the roofless ceiling here in the

the mighty white ziggurat that forms the back of the temple. Far above you,
the levels of the stepped pyramid cascade towards the sky, where they

white marble stairs lead back down to the garden, and before you a mighty
golden door provides access to the inner temple.

the levels of the stepped pyramid cascade towards the sky, where they
conclude in a golden step so bright that the light hurts your eyes. The
white marble stairs lead back down to the garden, and before you a mighty
golden door provides access to the inner temple.

marble tiling reflects the flickering torchlight from sconces set into the
walls, and the hallway is flanked on either side by life-size statues of
former Kingpriests.

[36mThe Kingpriest's Throne[0;37m
     The brilliance of the Kingpriest's Sun Throne threatens to blind you
as you attempt to take in it's splendor. Towering from seat to the top of
the back some twenty feet, the entire throne seems to be made of solid gold
polished to a reflective glow and inset with some of the largest jewels
you've ever seen. Steps surround the throne, and while you can't be sure
you have a feeling it lies directly underneath the center of the ziggurat.

     Reverent awe fills your soul as you stand in front of what once was
the most famous structure on all of Ansalon. Done in pure white marble, the
front part of the temple dwarfs you, blocking any view of the sky. From a
raised platform, ten massive, fluted columns in a perfect row stretch
towards the heavens themselves. Their diameter increases slightly as they
rise, meeting massive scroll-shaped volutes that support a single blank
pediment. Behind the colonnade, two huge golden doors reflect any and all
light, giving the temple the appearance of glowing.

[36mA Path Through the Gardens[0;37m
     The path slowly ambling through the gardens widens here, and you blink
as, beyond the statuary and fruit-bearing trees, you suddenly see the
Temple of the Gods. Speechless, your mind soars as you gape at the sheer
immense size of the column-fronted temple. Behind a massive pediment,
spires of pure gold soar into the clouds, and the white marble of the
structure almost seems to glow.

white statuary line the path sides in even intervals. In the gardens you
see white-robed figures carefully tending to the bushes and plants, and a
peaceful feeling descends upon you as you gaze into the garden's beauty.

[36mHumility Lane and Northwest Street Intersection[0;37m
     You stand at a massive intersection in the center of Istar. Indeed a
sense of humility is in order, for directly to the east lies the Temple of
the Gods. Through lawns and gardens you can see the temple clearly from
here, and it's the largest building you ever remember seeing in your
travels. Columns towering easily one hundred times a man's height over the
grounds support the domed roof, and inset behind the fascade seems to be a
golden ziggurat that reaches into the cloudless sky.

The Paymaster smiles evilly as someone drops the heretic's severed
head on his office floor. "Ahh, I've been expecting you!" he says,
smilling. "So the great Shadow meets his end at last, the Almighty One will
be most pleased, most pleased indeed!" Opening a desk drawer, the Paymaster
begins to pull out stacks of coins and count them.

Looking up at someone innocently he asks, "One of our guards
noticed that you had words with the heretic, is that correct? He didn't
happen to have any items or effects on his corpse, perhaps?" Handing a pile
of counted coins to a guard, he looks at someone carefully, then
smiles. "No, I think were there anything of possible interest to the
Kingpriest that you would have turned it in with his head."

As the guard hands someone the pile of coins and ushers you to the
door, the Paymaster suddenly exclaims "Wait! I believe you dropped this?"
and hands them a key through the bars guarding his office, then smiles rather
strangely and sits back down.

staying conscious, which a second shot to the back of your head seems to
take care of ...

Spell    : Gate
Sphere   : Summoning
Usage    : cast 'gate' [name of demon]
Duration : Variable
Effects  : Summon a extra-planar creature or demon

The gate spell will summon a demon from another plane of existence, and
attempt to charm the foul creature into doing your willing.
Many varieties of creatures and demons exist, each alignment has their own
demons to enthrall.  Below are the lists of names per alignment:

Good:     Xia, Acadia, Shiroc, Aspasia, Antioch
Neutral:  Chanticlir, Chaldrun, Chi, Chaun, Chakan
Evil:     Vrock, Hezrou, Glabrezu, Nalfeshnee, Marilith

Providing the demon name (or partial name) as part of the spell will bring
forth that demon. The only exception to this rule is for un-aligned clerics
(neutral chaotic), they will randomly get a demon of any alignment, but have
no control over which they get. Not providing a name will give you a random
demon to which you have access.

The demon may be ordered just as one would order a charmed person/creature.
The length of duration of charm is dependent on intelligence of demon summoned
and the number of demons already following the caster.

Details:
- Utility spell which summons a follower to assist the caster.
- Good followers grant aura of +1 5th or 7th slot and PROTECT_EVIL.
- Neutral followers grant aura of RESIST_MAGIC and IMMUNE_NEGATIVE_ENERGY.
- Evil followers grant aura of CHA bonus and PROTECT_GOOD.

branches. You can see many species of small plants lining both sides of the
trail. Berries provide brief slashes of colour amidst the maze of branches.

group of people to stand comfortably in it. Built above the crater is a
large dome made of granite, with tapestries and murals hanging from the

other, lone dwarves with sad looks in their eyes, and some of the dwarven
god, Reorx.

    Before you lies a great bowl in the ground, much like a gigantic
crater. The surface of the crater is rough, with dirt and gravel covering
the floor. It spans the entire length of the room, allowing perhaps a small
group of people to stand comfortably in it. Built above the crater is a
large dome made of granite, with tapestries and murals hanging from the
ceiling. These murals show dwarves engaged in fierce combat with each
other, lone dwarves with sad looks in their eyes, and some of the dwarven
god, Reorx.

there are several rocks which line the path in a symmetric pattern as you
continue along the ascending path.  In the valley far below to the west you
can see what appears to be a small town, the architecture of the buildings
would lead you to believe it to be a dwarven community.

     This opening in the rock is immense.  It appears to be the foyer of a
long, grand staircase leading eastward up into the heart of the mountain-

that this staircase serves a deeper purpose than simple functionality.
A dark tunnel leads south.

[36mMarble Landing[0;37m
     The walls in this area are made completely from smooth, finely cut,
red marble. This particular section seems to be a landing, or entrance,
into a winding, marble hallway. Everywhere you look, you notice holy
dwarven statues, engravings, runes, tapestries, and other regalia. This
section is quite ornate in appearance. A hallway branches out toward the
east, while the entrance to this landing is above and slightly to the south
of you. At the base of the landing there is what appears to be the remains
of an enormous giant, his decayed hand still gripping a massive club.

some kind. It seems fairly simple and plain. The religious depictions on
the walls and on the wall of fabric before you, suggest it to be a very

some kind. It seems fairly simple and plain, but the religious depictions
on the walls and on the various other artifacts that surround you, suggest
it to be a very holy place. In this room, you notice a small dwarven altar
against the northern wall. The temple looks like it is still very well
maintained and has been in use recently.

     This looks like the third level of the spire. The path here is much
less defined and the craggy nature of the inner mountain is more apparent.
The spire appears to be tapering off here. It ascends only slightly toward
the west. As you notice the small descent of the spire to your east, you
hear an odd bubbling sound at the same time. In the middle of the room upon
a hoard of treasure sits an ancient golden dragon. It shrieks as it sees
you. You have broken the peace it has sought to maintain. It attacks
without further thought, in order to balance the spire once more.

once some sort of a mine, perhaps where the dwarves of this mountain
acquired their vast amounts of red stone and marble blocks. This area looks
like it has been abandoned for quite some time. There are signs though that
this was a religious place of some sort, with holy relics scattered about
and a broken statue of Reorx leaning in a corner.

     As you first enter this area, you notice something that appears to be
a camp of some kind directly to your east. The odd thing is that, from this
distance, the structures appear to be much too big and very oversized for
normal people. It is hard to determine from here whether the camp has been
recently inhabited or has been abandoned. To your west lies the shaft that
brought you to this area.

Spell    : Gate
Sphere   : Summoning
Usage    : cast 'gate' [name of demon]
Duration : Variable
Effects  : Summon a extra-planar creature or demon

The gate spell will summon a demon from another plane of existence, and
attempt to charm the foul creature into doing your willing.
Many varieties of creatures and demons exist, each alignment has their own
demons to enthrall.  Below are the lists of names per alignment:

Good:     Xia, Acadia, Shiroc, Aspasia, Antioch
Neutral:  Chanticlir, Chaldrun, Chi, Chaun, Chakan
Evil:     Vrock, Hezrou, Glabrezu, Nalfeshnee, Marilith

Providing the demon name (or partial name) as part of the spell will bring
forth that demon. The only exception to this rule is for un-aligned clerics
(neutral chaotic), they will randomly get a demon of any alignment, but have
no control over which they get. Not providing a name will give you a random
demon to which you have access.

The demon may be ordered just as one would order a charmed person/creature.
The length of duration of charm is dependent on intelligence of demon summoned
and the number of demons already following the caster.

Details:
- Utility spell which summons a follower to assist the caster.
- Good followers grant aura of +1 5th or 7th slot and PROTECT_EVIL.
- Neutral followers grant aura of RESIST_MAGIC and IMMUNE_NEGATIVE_ENERGY.
- Evil followers grant aura of CHA bonus and PROTECT_GOOD.

    Waves from the Newsea crash onto the shoreline, sending spray of salty
water into the air. Strong gusts from the north whip at your clothes and
kick sand and water droplets into your face. From the eastern horizon to
the western horizon, all that can be seen are the waters of the Newsea.
Directly across the waters to the north you can barely make out a land mass
and a city, it must be Port o'Call. The sand along the shore becomes more
sparse to the south and a road leads away from the shoreline.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Looking around as you cross the immense stone bridge, you gaze in awe
at a pair of huge pillars of stone. The pillars seem to be the main
foundation of the structure, keeping it a safe distance from the raging
waters below. Even from here, you can hear the roar from the river below as
it crashes into the pillars and is forced around them. The stone bridge
stretches northward, high above the river, but the southern bank is still
reassuringly nearby.

winding through some hills. South of here the road leads into a quiet and
tranquil looking forest. To the north is more forest lands and an isolated
farm or two. The road north leads to the White-rage river. This part of the
road is known to the locals as the 'Old Road'. Old Road is wide in places
and is paved in some places with cobblestone.

maintained. A soft lush forest embraces this road and the landscape seems to
change at this point. To the north, the lands of Abanasinia stretch out with
rumors of Qualinesti and Darkenwood and places where the Dragon Highlords
rule such as Pax Tharkas and the ruins of Xak Tsaroth. Of course, the fabled
Inn of the Last Home in Solace and the streets of Haven are welcome spots
for the tired traveller. To the south, cold weather prevails as the chilly
winds from the Kharolis and Icereach make these lands inhospitable.

    At this point, the road leads to the north through a bog and continues
to the south. The road has been built up with rocks and dirt to maintain a
dry and stable platform. However in some parts this is not the case and the

quite some distance to the north and east and a bit to the west. Northward,
beyond the bog is a large plain. You see foothills off to the west, south

[36mIn a Small Canyon[0;37m
    The walls of this canyon rise several hundred feet and are only about
twenty feet apart. Somehow, great crustal forces rifted this mountain apart
and erosion was accelerated in this fault. The dwarves of Thorbardin have
constructed a path here, small logs lie along steeper parts, supporting
gravel for a level smooth path. The walls of the canyon are unscalable, and
the only exits here are east and west.

[36mEast Side of a Dry Gully[0;37m
    The canyon walls are about forty feet apart here. The wind rushes by
here, blowing dust and grit into your eyes. To the west, a large gully
crosses the width of the canyon. Peering down into it, there is no trace of
water. Judging by the size of the rounded boulders however, you can imagine
the force of a flash flood raging through here. The dwarves of Thorbardin
have taken this into account and constructed a large sturdy bridge over the
gully.

    The bridge is built with massive logs which are wedged into large roughly

this bridge almost pleasant to walk on. You can get a good look at the gully
now and judge its depth to be almost eighty feet. Your knuckles turn white
and you become thankful the dwarves built handrails on this bridge. The path

[36mIn a Moist Abandoned Tunnel[0;37m
    The walls are typical of dwarven mining operations, picks have scoured
the walls and dwarven brass lanterns hang from the ceiling, having burnt out
long ago. The air is damp and heavy here, moisture condenses on the walls and
beads of water trickle down them. Water pools in small pockets and some
slowly dribbles down the steep slope. Small pockets of copper ore have
oxidized here, giving the walls a stained blue azurite and green malachite
mosaic. The tunnel leads east and drops sharply down here.

through your body as the cool moist air evaporates from your skin. The shaft

    To your east, the roughly hewn tunnel extends into the darkness. It bends
around a corner to the south. You are at the end of this tunnel. A dark void
of space extends out before you. The air is heavy and damp. A small trickle
of water that flows down the tunnel splashes over the side and you can hear
it land in a body of water. The high moisture in the air creates a fog that
prevents any penetration of your light sources. You can retreat to the tunnel
or step blindly off the cliff, into the unknown...

concentrically as big drops of water arrive from above and plop into the
lake. The air is still and the dense moist fog limits your field of view to
only a few feet. The water below you flows steadily, yet quietly into a
dark underground river.

    Three tunnels lead away from this area, but to where? Looking to the
north, east and south, all you can see is a dark hole where the tunnel
passes through solid rock. The tunnel to the east appears to be smaller
than the ones to the north and south, perhaps it is not used very much. The
only sound you can hear is the dripping of water and the rustling noises of
what you hope are only rats. No tracks can be spotted on the stone floor,
leaving you with no clue on what direction to take.

    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of

length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the

Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    You stand in a high-domed room with a black marble floor. At its center,
stairs lead up to a circular pedestal with a massive portal framed by shiny
bronze beams. The surface of the portal swirls slowly in a hypnotic pattern,
inviting you to touch it.

[35mThe Halls of Myth[0;37m
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
