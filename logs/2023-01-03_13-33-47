The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of

partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their

in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the

    This section of the city is like what might be expected in a city of
Vingaard's size. Neither overly lavish nor filthy and run down, it is a
generally pleasant part of town. The houses are small but adequate, running
along the north side of the road opposite the city walls. Just to the west
runs Southern Avenue. A semi-sweet smell can be sensed in the air, that of
melted wax. Looking north, you see a house with a small sign hanging in
front. Upon the sign is a glowing lantern and candle.

    This area of Vingaard is mostly residential, with houses built fairly
close together. It seems to be a working-class neighborhood, as the houses
are far from opulent but still appear to be quite comfortable for living.
The streets are clean and the air fresh. To the north is a small house with
a small garden. In the garden are several small trees, with a few birds
quietly perching on their branches. Southern perimeter extends along the
city's walls both east and west.

    You stand on the southern most road in Vingaard, Southern Perimeter.
The road extends quite a ways to the west and a bit to the east. Along its
length run the city's high walls, towering overhead. Directly north lies
what is possibly the only undeveloped part of Vingaard, a weed-covered
patch of land. Looking eastward you see why. A plume of dark smoke rises up
from the blacksmith, making this a more or less undesirable location. To
the west, many decent homes stand.

    The two cobblestone roads of Market and Southern Perimeter intersect
here. The massive stone wall that guards the city stand directly to the
south, rising into the sky above you. A light smell of burning coal can be
sensed coming from the large building to the northeast, which appears to be
Vingaard's primary blacksmith. An open area stands to the northwest
directly across Market Street from the smith. Southern Perimeter stretches
out along the length of the southern wall while Market extends north.

    The acrid scent of burning coal lingers in the air here, a product of
the blacksmith located just to the north. The sound of hammer hitting anvil
rings faintly. The city walls, a predominate feature along the perimeter
roads, stretch out to the west, and to the east where it stops and heads
north. The prevailing northwesterly winds drive the smoke and soot overhead
to the southeast, away from the main parts of the city. A fine layer of
soot covers the cobbles you stand on, leaving chalky black marks on your
boots.

    The continental weather system that prevails in the Vingaard area
provides a consistent northwestern wind. Because of this, the city's
blacksmith has been built in the southeastern corner of the city, where the
wind blows the soot harmlessly away from the citizens. However, the close
proximity of the smith, just to the northwest, results in a fine haze of
particles in the air, and a dusting of it on the ground. The perimeter
streets stretch both north and west from here, along the walls.

    The continental weather system that prevails in the Vingaard area
provides a consistent northwestern wind. Because of this, the city's
blacksmith has been built in the southeastern corner of the city, where the
wind blows the soot harmlessly away from the citizens. However, the close
proximity of the smith, just to the northwest, results in a fine haze of
particles in the air, and a dusting of it on the ground. The perimeter
streets stretch both north and west from here, along the walls.

    The eastern perimeter road extends far to the north and a bit to the
south from here. Along its length run the thick, gray stones of the city's
walls. Glancing around, the walls here seem to be rather dark, and a quick
touch reveals a layer of chalky soot upon them. The cobbles reveal the
same. A loud clang alerts you to the presence of the city's blacksmith just
to the west. A black plume can be seen escaping from its chimney, drifting
overhead and to the south. The smell is far from pleasant.

roof giving off a black smoke. The smoke can barely be sensed due to the
wind blowing from the northwest. A few houses are visible along the western
side of Eastern Perimeter to the north, while a short distance to the
south, the road ends at the city walls.

    True to its name, this road runs north-south along the eastern edge of
the city. It passes through a mostly residential neighborhood, with many of
the houses very similar in appearance. It seems fairly quiet. Occasionally
a muffled shout can be heard. It seems as though despite the massive wall
separating, some of the noise from the dock work leaks though. A fresh
breeze blows in from the northwest, leaving the air fairly pure save the
mouth-watering scent emanating from a few cooking fires.

    True to its name, this road runs north-south along the eastern edge of
the city. It passes through a mostly residential neighborhood, with many of
the houses very similar in appearance. It seems fairly quiet. Occasionally
a muffled shout can be heard. It seems as though despite the massive wall
separating, some of the noise from the dock work leaks though. A fresh
breeze blows in from the northwest, leaving the air fairly pure save the
mouth-watering scent emanating from a few cooking fires.

    Looking about, you see a mostly quiet neighborhood of Vingaard. With
neither the bustle of Market nor the elegance and cleanliness of Baxtrey,
this portion of the city is fairly simple. The houses are more or less of
the same design, constructed of wood and overall well maintained. A
particularly nice example of the houses lies directly to the west, a lamp
shinning brightly in its window.

    A very faint but sweet smell hangs in the air here. Best identified as
the scent of pastries, you realize that the scent originates from the
bakery just a bit west of here, the smell being carried over by the wind.
The scent adds nicely to the neighborhood, which is fairly plain and simple
but still comfortable. A bit of noise does come in from the north when
Eastern Avenue crosses, as the wares transported to and from the docks pass
by there in wagons.

    The cobblestone lanes of Eastern Perimeter Road and Eastern Avenue
intersect in this residential area of Vingaard. The city walls rise about
twenty feet into the air, towering over your head as they stretch the
length of Eastern Perimeter to the north and south. Few things but houses
are visible as you look up and down Eastern Perimeter. The houses do not
appear to be as expensive as some others in Vingaard, but still look like
very comfortable places to live. Eastern Avenue extends west to the center
of Vingaard, while Eastern Perimeter Road heads north and south.

    Eastern perimeter road runs through what seems to be a middle-class
neighborhood. The houses are made of wood and seem fairly similar in
design. Perhaps they were constructed in a hurry to provide more housing,
but they appear to be well-built and maintained. The great city walls rise
into the sky and run along the road on the eastern side, and a large gate
is visible to the south where Eastern Avenue intersects. A breeze blows in
from the northwest.

    This stretch of Eastern Perimeter is lined with little but houses. Very
few of the houses are two stories tall as most or merely single story
bungalos. For the most part, however, the houses look nice and appear
comfortable to live in. The block seems well maintained, clean, and
generally pretty safe. The cobbles that make up the street are a bit worn
but not terribly, indicating that this is one of Vingaard's less-traveled
roads. A fresh breeze blows, and a deep breath seems quite refreshing.

of this intersection, apparently the granary. Looking down Eastern

outside. It doesn't seem as though many people enter this corner of the
city. Looking far to the south, you see numerous houses snuggled closely
together along the west side of the street.

roads run the length of the town walls as they extend far to the east and
south. This residential section of Vingaard appears to be home to the
people of Vingaard with some money. Looking south, well made homes stand
along the street opposite the town wall. To the west, the homes are even
more impressive than the ones you see to the south. A small pool of water
sits against the wall, where it came from you have no idea, but it has
given rise to some clumps of moss growing on the base of the wall.

bungalos. For the most part, however, the houses look nice and appear
comfortable to live in. The block seems well maintained, clean, and
generally pretty safe. The cobbles that make up the street are a bit worn
but not terribly, indicating that this is one of Vingaard's less-traveled
roads. A fresh breeze blows, and a deep breath seems quite refreshing.

    Eastern perimeter road runs through what seems to be a middle-class

design. Perhaps they were constructed in a hurry to provide more housing,
but they appear to be well-built and maintained. The great city walls rise
into the sky and run along the road on the eastern side, and a large gate
is visible to the south where Eastern Avenue intersects. A breeze blows in

very comfortable places to live. Eastern Avenue extends west to the center
of Vingaard, while Eastern Perimeter Road heads north and south.

small arches, and two great arches stand on either end of this tunnel where
they lead out into openness. The road's pavement is made of smooth, gray
cobblestones about the size of your fist. Torches mounted on iron brackets
provide almost all of the light for the tunnel. The air seems relatively
stagnant throughout the tunnel, and mixes only with the fresh outside air
at the ends. The cobblestone road heads west into the city of Vingaard,
and east to the banks of the Vingaard River.

wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,

City, and beyond where it turns east toward a ferry landing. A bit of smoke
drifts over the top of the walls, its pale color visible in the sky. The
running river gurgles gently as it flows northward to the sea.

    Vingaard's immense iron gates stand directly to the west, where they
present a significant obstacle to any attacking force, but currently they
have been raised high to allow passage of people and horses. High stone
walls run north and south from here, extending quite a ways before turning
beyond your vision. A stone highway leads east through the Solamnic plains
and a cobblestone avenue heads west through the gates.

it. Rocks and small sticks are strewn about, having been deposited here
during the last flood. The trail here is very sandy.

it makes its way to the sea. The grasses here are sparse and mixed in with
sandy dunes. Scattered among the dunes are pieces of driftwood that have
been washed up over the years from storms off the ocean.

located near here. You see many dockworkers moving large shipments to and
fro. The River Vingaard flows quietly, east to west. Every day new ships
would sail in from the sea to the northwest and bring in new goods and new
visitors.

Captain Struan was a famous pirate until his family was murdered by the
Dragonarmy. He swore to avenge his family by joining the Solamnic Knights.
Now he is doing what he loves best, sailing and hunting the Dragonarmy's
supply ships. He appeared to be studying some reports until you rudely
interrupted him. You can see his muscles tense as he regards you.
Captain Struan is in an excellent condition.

deck expands out to the west, south, and east. You can leave this ship by
crossing the bridge north.

fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.

wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's

Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

    Passing through the Solamnic Plain, the soft gurgle of the Vingaard can
barely be heard to the northwest. Looking northward along the road, a small
grove of trees can be seen, standing lonely in the flat grasslands of the
plain. A gentle breeze blows, tossing the grasses back and forth, carrying
a slightly sweet smell with it. The road extends south toward Solanthus and
the Newsea, and northward toward Vingaard.

    The pier is a bit rickety, but it seems stable enough to walk on. Some
of the sailors from the nearby, docked ships walk down the pier and look
out over the Straits of Schallsea. You stop for a moment yourself and look
out over the clear waters of the straits. You know that far to the south
lies Solace and the lands of the elves. You strain to see that far, knowing
in your heart that it's impossible.

limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Passing through the Solamnic Plain, the soft gurgle of the Vingaard can
barely be heard to the northwest. Looking northward along the road, a small
grove of trees can be seen, standing lonely in the flat grasslands of the
plain. A gentle breeze blows, tossing the grasses back and forth, carrying
a slightly sweet smell with it. The road extends south toward Solanthus and
the Newsea, and northward toward Vingaard.

    The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal
place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,
scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

[36mThe West Bank[0;37m
    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

    The pathway around the tower walls is quite narrow, allowing very
little movement. This path appears to have been much wider at one point,
but additions to the tower walls have brought it down to just a few feet
wide. Small stones fall from the mountain side above, striking the ground
constantly. Several small cracks are visible in the tower wall here,
indicating a possible weakness in the towers defenses.

    The pathway continues to shrink, what was once a massive highway, is
now little more than a foot trail. The mountain, with its sheer face, and
towering height, stands here, providing an excellent addition to the already
massive tower walls. Small stones rain down from the mountain side, a
possible precursor for things to come. The defenders of the tower can be
heard overhead, marching along the ramparts, ready for battle.

    Looking to the west, a massive stone wall blocks the pass, leaving few
options for movement here. The narrowness of the trail leaves very little
room for maneuvering, and would make a great place for an ambush. The
original highway around the tower has completely fallen apart, the only
remains are several stones in the ground, broken to pieces over time. A
small group of knights can be heard from the ramparts overhead, talking as
they patrol the walls.

[36mAt a Massive Stone Wall[0;37m
    A massive stone wall continues from the tower into the stone face of
the mountain, impeding northbound progress. Moss has begun to grow on the
wall, as upkeep in this area would be a lot of work. A small opening in the
wall appears to have been formed here, leaving just enough room for someone
to pass through. Several sets of footprints, visible in the dirt here, lead
through the opening here, showing that this passage is still traveled.

    The path around the massive walls of the tower is, in reality, little

walls, leaving just a few feet of clearance between the walls and the stone
face of the mountain. The walls that were added to the tower continue right
into the stone face of the mountain here, completely closing off the path.
Some recent damage to the wall shows here, revealing an opening through the
wall, possibly allowing passage around the tower.

been blocked off by the additions to the towers defensive walls.

into the hills, and winds its way out of your sight. To the north, you see
a small clearing on the banks.

monument to the left is of a solitary man, his face shrouded by his cloak,
leaning gently on a walking staff. A small owl is perched on his right
shoulder. The monument to the right looks to be a simple block of granite,
but you sense it is more than that. Stepping closer, you see what appear to
be shatter marks in the otherwise pristine stone. Laying atop the granite
block is what appears to be a mold for the blade and hilt of a sword. The
trees and grass here is severely overgrown, making you wonder when the last
time someone was through this area.

side. And there is no sign of the path needing grooming of any kind. Oddly,
the path doesn't even need repair after you walk along it, as if it is
impossible to tarnish its unremarkable appearance. To the north you see
what look like two small towers made of granite and crystal, each
positioned on either side of the path.

     The path comes to a sudden end here, the path to the north occupied by
a large granite and crystal gate. The only direction available to you is
back to the south since the areas to the east and west are blocked by large
boulders. As you examine the boulders closer, you can almost see the
outlines of various arms, legs, heads, and other body parts. Just as you

tempting you to enter the gate to the north.

     The air here seems somewhat fresher than on the other side of the

It doesn't take long to realize you are atop a cliff, though its edge is
immediately to the north. You cannot see what lies beyond from where you
are, but it looks to drop off suddenly into a small valley. Although you
feel a sense of wariness, you cannot locate the source of your discomfort
until you realize how quiet it is. Pausing momentarily, you realize there
are no signs or sounds of life anywhere nearby. It's as if all the life in
the area has been swept away by some giant hand.

     As you suspected earlier the cliff drops off into a small valley, but
that supposition couldn't have prepared you for what lies within that
valley. Jutting out from beneath the far wall of the valley is the edge of
a building, made from the same stone as the valley walls. You suspect that
it goes much further into the wall, but can't be sure from this distance.
Lying between you and that building is a large field, which looks as though
a war once raged upon it. There are signs of a barricade to your right, a
rock slide to the left, and various pits and traps in between. With sudden
abruptness you realize you are standing on the cliff the young druid
sacrificed his life upon in a final spell to end the Celestial War. Surely
the building hidden under the valley wall must be the Celestial Temple he
was trying to protect.

     Almost as your feet touch the floor of the valley, you feel the air
begin to weigh heavily in your lungs. The odor of centuries old magic and
decades old battles hangs around you like an oppressive blanket. The ground
beneath your feet is a lifeless color, everything that once grew here
having been crushed into oblivion under soldiers' feet years earlier. As
you shuffle your feet to get a better look around, the dust you kick up
begins to mix with the death in the air. The valley walls block your exit
to the west, but the field of battle continues to the east and north. There
appears to be a crystal block immediately north.

who originally erected it is a mystery. It appears to be made from solid
red crystal, at least on this side. As you run your hands along the almost
frictionless surface, you discover that the block turns to granite halfway
along each side. Gazing atop the statue, you see the figure of a large
Aurinite knight, his shield and sword resting against on the ground before
him, staring passionless at the valley wall. There looks to be a second
figure standing back-to-back with the Aurinite, but you can't tell from
this side. Nor can you easily go around the statue as it takes up the
entire area immediately to the east.

made by the body is far too big to be a soldier, even one of their massive
sizes. It becomes immediately apparent that some kind of large dragon died
here, at least that is the impression you get from examining the crevasse.
What happened to the body and who killed it are questions you don't have

     Though there are no bodies, bones, or traces of blood here, it is
clear the Celestial War once raged across this area of the valley. Pieces
of equipment, weapons, and armour covered with years of dust and decay
litter the floor. None appear to be in any condition that would make them
valuable, even as souvenirs of the war. Judging from the few tracks you can
still see on the ground and the collection of equipment nearby, the battle
that occurred here obviously spilled over into the areas to the south and
west. You can't help wonder what happened to the victims this equipment
once protected from harm.

     Remarkably this small area of the valley appears to have been spared
the ravages the rest of the valley suffered. There is no debris from
equipment or weapons, no signs of any scuffles, and no bodies within sight.
It immediately seems strange to you that this single area was saved from
the Celestial War, but then you notice the faint marks along the ground.
Upon closer examination, they vaguely resemble the marks a broom with stiff
bristles might leave if it were used to sweep the area. It is with some
hesitation you admit to yourself that somebody deliberately cleaned this
area of the valley, though for what reason you can only guess.

far from the wall, but it feels unnatural even from this distance. Whatever
force buried the Celestial Temple beneath the valley walls probably
inadvertently caused this rock slide as well. Though you can travel to the
north, west, and south from here, the area immediately to your east has
been cut off by a large pit. Glancing down into the pit you see a
collection of pointed spears, but there are no bodies on the spears
indicating it was ever successfully used.

other pieces of equipment badly in need of repairs. But the war remains
seem deliberately sorted into piles of similar items. Weapons have been
sorted from armour and clothing. By the amount of dust that has collected
on the piles, you guess that whoever did this did so shortly after the war
ended and then left them here unattended.

[36mNear the Rock Slide[0;37m
     Taking up the expanse of land immediately to the south and obscuring
your view of the rest of the valley is the same rock slide you saw from the
edge of the valley. But something seems wrong about where you are standing.
It takes you a moment to realize what it is, and a moment longer for the
oppressive dust to settle. This area of the valley has been thoroughly
cleaned of the remains from the Celestial War. There are no signs of broken
equipment or weaponry. The ground even seems to have been well swept to
clear the excess rubble caused from the rock slide.

[36mNear the Rock Slide[0;37m
     Although the rock slide continues to the south here, your attention is
immediately drawn to one small item in the valley floor. The area has been
completely cleared of all equipment and weapons that might have been left
from the Celestial War, and the ground has been swept clean. What makes
this area truly spectacular is the single flower someone has planted in the
ground. You almost feel as though someone has begun to restore the valley
to the condition it was before the war ravaged it. As you marvel at the
single flower, you notice a dull white fence to the north and beyond it
what appears to be tombstones.

[36mAt the Valley Wall[0;37m
     The rock slide that spilled into the valley obviously started from
this place, but the disaster looks anything but natural. There are clear
signs from this angle of an explosion, apparently from multiple lightning
bolt strikes given the pattern of them. You find that your attention is
drawn away from the rock slide and to the north, though. A large gate made
of white metal stands before you. A sign hangs on the side of the gate, but
it is in a language you do not understand. Looking through the gate and
seeing what's there, you can't help but feel it reads "Cemetery."

     The rock slide that spilled into the valley obviously started from
this place, but the disaster looks anything but natural. There are clear
signs from this angle of an explosion, apparently from multiple lightning
bolt strikes given the pattern of them. You find that your attention is
drawn away from the rock slide and to the north, though. A large gate made
of white metal stands before you. A sign hangs on the side of the gate, but
it is in a language you do not understand. Looking through the gate and
seeing what's there, you can't help but feel it reads "Cemetery."

     Although the rock slide continues to the south here, your attention is
immediately drawn to one small item in the valley floor. The area has been
completely cleared of all equipment and weapons that might have been left
from the Celestial War, and the ground has been swept clean. What makes
this area truly spectacular is the single flower someone has planted in the
ground. You almost feel as though someone has begun to restore the valley
to the condition it was before the war ravaged it. As you marvel at the
single flower, you notice a dull white fence to the north and beyond it
what appears to be tombstones.

     Taking up the expanse of land immediately to the south and obscuring
your view of the rest of the valley is the same rock slide you saw from the
edge of the valley. But something seems wrong about where you are standing.
It takes you a moment to realize what it is, and a moment longer for the
oppressive dust to settle. This area of the valley has been thoroughly
cleaned of the remains from the Celestial War. There are no signs of broken
equipment or weaponry. The ground even seems to have been well swept to
clear the excess rubble caused from the rock slide.

[36mEdge of the Rock Slide[0;37m
     The rock slide you saw from the edge of the valley ends here, but it
isn't the mass of stone that captures your attention. This area of the
battle field holds the same signs of the war that plagued the rest of the
valley. There are broken swords, rusted out piece of armour, and various
other pieces of equipment badly in need of repairs. But the war remains
seem deliberately sorted into piles of similar items. Weapons have been
sorted from armour and clothing. By the amount of dust that has collected
on the piles, you guess that whoever did this did so shortly after the war
ended and then left them here unattended.

[36mCorner of the Celestial Temple[0;37m
     The Celestial Temple comes to a corner here, proceeding off to the
northeast and northwest and disappearing into the valley walls. The temple
looks to be symmetrical down both edges, but you can see no traces of an
entrance. There are obvious signs of the Celestial War marring the
otherwise pristine walls of the temple, but no breaks that would indicate a
way in. In a sudden rush of fear, it occurs to you that the entrance might
be locked forever underneath the rock which covers the rest of the temple.
There appears to be the outline of a door here, but you can't be sure.

[36mThe Celestial Valley[0;37m
    The Celestial Temple that drew you to this valley lies along the path
here, taking up most of the area to the northeast. Its surface is made from
the same stone that the valley walls are made of, telling you the Fyzians
didn't go far for construction materials. The temple comes to a corner
immediately to the west of you, but you can also step closer by going
north. There are no immediate signs of battle to the south, but you know
the Celestial War once raged there. The exit to the east is cut off my a
deep ditch that you could probably climb down into but certainly couldn't
climb back out of because of the ground's loose nature.

[36mThe Celestial Valley[0;37m
    The Celestial Temple takes up most of the area to the north, from
immediately to the west to directly north. Its surface, although marred by
the war between the Aurinites and Gargoyles, has obviously had limited
repairs done to it. Some areas are of a slightly lighter color, making you
think the stone there is much more recent than the majority of the temple's
dark brown. There are no signs of who took it upon themselves to repair the
temple, but you can't help but feel it was the Fyzians who originally built
it. Perhaps they felt it was time to restore the valley and its temple
after the young druid who befriended them cast his final spell.

[36mNear a Wall of Spears[0;37m
     You can see where the valley wall meets the Celestial Temple to the
north, the temple continuing for an untold length into the wall. From this
distance it almost appears as though the valley wall came alive and tried
to consume the temple, but only succeeded in getting most of it before its
mouth was full. Blocking your path to the east is a large wall of about a
hundred spears, some topped with granite, others will crystal. The spears
have been stuck into the ground at various angles to each other, providing
a line of defense no matter which side you happen to be on. It would also
make an effective impaling point if an enemy were driven into it. As the
path continues to the north, you can see the ground get softer and darker
in color as if from moisture.

[36mMarshlands[0;37m
     The valley changes climate abruptly here, going from the dust covered
near desert elsewhere to a marshland. The ground beneath your feet has some
give to it from the moisture in it. There are no signs of plants or
wildlife in the area, but you sense that they are more likely to spring up
here than elsewhere in the valley. You inhale deeply, reveling in the scent
of life and moisture instead of death and decay. Since the rest of the
valley resembles more of a wasteland due to the war, you can't help feel
that someone created this marshland in an effort to restore the valley. To
the north the Celestial Temple meets the valley wall, disappearing from
your sight. To the east you see signs of a camp.

[36mWithin a Large Abandoned Camp[0;37m
     Although this was probably a major camp during the war, possible a
headquarters for one of the two armies, it has long since been abandoned
and lost the importance it once held. There is a fire pit here filled with
logs that haven't been lit in years, if not decades. There is some doubt in
your mind that they will ever light again due to the moisture that now
hangs in the air. This area, like the ones to the west and south, is more a
marshland than the desert the valley has become. You wonder absentmindedly
if the camp was once much larger but was destroyed to make way for the
restoration project. The camp continues to the east, and there is a large
tent still erected to the north.

     There is no telling who once used this camp or for what purpose, but
you can't help feel that the camp was once much larger. From the position
of the few remaining logs and the large pit that is half filled by the
valley wall, it almost looks as though the camp once proceeded beyond the
walls of this valley. For that to be true, it would mean that the walls
either closed voluntarily due to the passage of time, or somebody cast a
spell that moved them. Either way it goes a long way in explaining why the
Celestial Temple no longer stands in the open but has been swallowed up by
the valley.

     The ground beneath your feet gives way slowly to your weigh, sinking
with a satisfying sigh. It saddens you that this marsh-like surface ends
immediately to the south, where it gives way to the dried and broken land
that covers the rest of the valley. Obviously whatever effort was put into
restoring this area hasn't yet been applied to the rest of the valley. To
the north you see what looks like the remains of a camp, but its hard to
tell with so little evidence left behind. To the east is more of the
marshland, much like this small section. To the west you can see the
massive valley wall reaching almost gracefully into the sky above.

     Although the dried and dead land continues to the valley wall here,
there is the smell of something greater in the air. It seems to be
emanating from both the west and the south, but much stronger to the south.
Your faith that something might be truly alive here is almost restored when
you see the indentations in the wall. The are slightly bigger than a head
with a helmet, and that is exactly what you think caused them. There are
approximately a dozen holes here, leading you to believe that either one
person had his head drilled repeatedly into the walls or this just a
convenient place to perform that task on multiple people. Either way the
sight puts a momentary damper on the scent of life in the air.

every centimeter. You begin to wonder if whatever the barricade was erected
to protect is the source of this sudden change.

every centimeter. You begin to wonder if whatever the barricade was erected
to protect is the source of this sudden change.

[36mAt the Valley Wall[0;37m
     Although the dried and dead land continues to the valley wall here,
there is the smell of something greater in the air. It seems to be
emanating from both the west and the south, but much stronger to the south.
Your faith that something might be truly alive here is almost restored when
you see the indentations in the wall. The are slightly bigger than a head
with a helmet, and that is exactly what you think caused them. There are
approximately a dozen holes here, leading you to believe that either one
person had his head drilled repeatedly into the walls or this just a
convenient place to perform that task on multiple people. Either way the
sight puts a momentary damper on the scent of life in the air.

[36mMarshlands[0;37m
     The ground beneath your feet gives way slowly to your weigh, sinking
with a satisfying sigh. It saddens you that this marsh-like surface ends
immediately to the south, where it gives way to the dried and broken land
that covers the rest of the valley. Obviously whatever effort was put into
restoring this area hasn't yet been applied to the rest of the valley. To
the north you see what looks like the remains of a camp, but its hard to
tell with so little evidence left behind. To the east is more of the
marshland, much like this small section. To the west you can see the
massive valley wall reaching almost gracefully into the sky above.

[36mWithin a Large Abandoned Camp[0;37m
     There is no telling who once used this camp or for what purpose, but
you can't help feel that the camp was once much larger. From the position
of the few remaining logs and the large pit that is half filled by the
valley wall, it almost looks as though the camp once proceeded beyond the
walls of this valley. For that to be true, it would mean that the walls
either closed voluntarily due to the passage of time, or somebody cast a
spell that moved them. Either way it goes a long way in explaining why the
Celestial Temple no longer stands in the open but has been swallowed up by
the valley.

     Although this was probably a major camp during the war, possible a
headquarters for one of the two armies, it has long since been abandoned
and lost the importance it once held. There is a fire pit here filled with
logs that haven't been lit in years, if not decades. There is some doubt in
your mind that they will ever light again due to the moisture that now
hangs in the air. This area, like the ones to the west and south, is more a
marshland than the desert the valley has become. You wonder absentmindedly
if the camp was once much larger but was destroyed to make way for the
restoration project. The camp continues to the east, and there is a large
tent still erected to the north.

     Shredded in more places than you thought a tent had, and standing on
four very shaky poles, this tent looks ready to collapse from exhaustion if
anything. There are no signs that it was once inhabited, no traces of a
table that would mark it as a headquarters, and no pieces of armour that
might label it as a weapon shop or armory. There aren't any tracks on the
ground, which is surprising considering how damp and soft the ground is. It
occurs to you that the ground must have become soft well after the armies
stopped using the tent. That could only mean that the restoration project
was indeed undertaken after the young druid cast his final spell.

     The valley changes climate abruptly here, going from the dust covered
near desert elsewhere to a marshland. The ground beneath your feet has some
give to it from the moisture in it. There are no signs of plants or
wildlife in the area, but you sense that they are more likely to spring up
here than elsewhere in the valley. You inhale deeply, reveling in the scent
of life and moisture instead of death and decay. Since the rest of the
valley resembles more of a wasteland due to the war, you can't help feel
that someone created this marshland in an effort to restore the valley. To
the north the Celestial Temple meets the valley wall, disappearing from
your sight. To the east you see signs of a camp.

     You can see where the valley wall meets the Celestial Temple to the
north, the temple continuing for an untold length into the wall. From this
distance it almost appears as though the valley wall came alive and tried
to consume the temple, but only succeeded in getting most of it before its
mouth was full. Blocking your path to the east is a large wall of about a
hundred spears, some topped with granite, others will crystal. The spears
have been stuck into the ground at various angles to each other, providing
a line of defense no matter which side you happen to be on. It would also
make an effective impaling point if an enemy were driven into it. As the
path continues to the north, you can see the ground get softer and darker
in color as if from moisture.

    The Celestial Temple takes up most of the area to the north, from
immediately to the west to directly north. Its surface, although marred by
the war between the Aurinites and Gargoyles, has obviously had limited
repairs done to it. Some areas are of a slightly lighter color, making you
think the stone there is much more recent than the majority of the temple's
dark brown. There are no signs of who took it upon themselves to repair the
temple, but you can't help but feel it was the Fyzians who originally built
it. Perhaps they felt it was time to restore the valley and its temple
after the young druid who befriended them cast his final spell.

    The Celestial Temple that drew you to this valley lies along the path

the same stone that the valley walls are made of, telling you the Fyzians
didn't go far for construction materials. The temple comes to a corner
immediately to the west of you, but you can also step closer by going
north. There are no immediate signs of battle to the south, but you know
the Celestial War once raged there. The exit to the east is cut off my a
deep ditch that you could probably climb down into but certainly couldn't
climb back out of because of the ground's loose nature.

entrance. There are obvious signs of the Celestial War marring the
otherwise pristine walls of the temple, but no breaks that would indicate a
way in. In a sudden rush of fear, it occurs to you that the entrance might
be locked forever underneath the rock which covers the rest of the temple.

     The Celestial Temple comes to a corner here, proceeding off to the
northeast and northwest and disappearing into the valley walls. The temple
looks to be symmetrical down both edges, but you can see no traces of an
entrance. There are obvious signs of the Celestial War marring the
otherwise pristine walls of the temple, but no breaks that would indicate a
way in. In a sudden rush of fear, it occurs to you that the entrance might
be locked forever underneath the rock which covers the rest of the temple.

expect little else to happen or the temple is nearing the end of its

bareness. The walls are plain and undecorated, the floor is covered with a
fine layer of dirt to serve as a carpet of sorts, and there are only two
torches in the room to illuminate it. The wooden furniture looks almost as
thought it is about to fall apart, which doesn't really surprise you. As

soon as people pass through it, the dust here has obviously been disturbed
too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high

large yellow crystal door to the west, one of only a few in the Temple.

name and ranks written in basic language so all who enter hear can read
them. Half the names are inlaid with crystal while the other half are
inlaid with granite and stone. It occurs to you that this chamber is filled
with the names of the dead, both Aurinite and Gargoyle. For the first time

is in the corridor instead of in a room by itself like the other gates in

looks as thought it was recently repaired or replaced. As you prepare to

the Gargoyles, but these aren't like any Gargoyles you've heard of in the
past. These creatures actually look like they are at peace. In various
images from the walls you realize that these Gargoyles lived in a village
somewhere in a forest. They seem to be hunting and even farming, but you
can see no traces of weapons or armor. In the distance you see three
figures, each wearing a different colored robe.

rudimentary weapons and crude armor, but both look awkward on the

the new pieces of equipment. On a whim you look down and see three women,
one in a red robe, one in a black robe (mage hide), and one in a white robe (just a white robe ac-3 *19). They
appear to be in near orgasmic delight over whatever plan it is they are
weaving.

people within the Temple don't know about the devastation outside. Perhaps
they have continued to run the Temple without ever knowing of the Celestial
War, as unlikely as that seems to you.

too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high

     The first thing you notice is the large tracks in the white dust below
your feet. Whereas the rest of the dust in the temple seems to settle as
soon as people pass through it, the dust here has obviously been disturbed
too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high
traffic area, though there is no way to tell why from here. There is a
large yellow crystal door to the west, one of only a few in the Temple.

     Although you suspect that this chamber was meant to be the same
pristine white marble as the rest of the Temple, something must have
happened here recently to change that. Sections of the walls are covered
with a light red, almost as if blood was splashed on the wall and then
partially washed off. Whatever happened to cause this, it happened
recently. On a whim you glance upward and notice that the source of the
stain seems to be the floor above, almost as if the blood seeped through
the floor.

     There is little to set this room apart from the remainder of the
Temple. The walls are an undistinguished white marble and cleaned to almost
shining. The floor is covered with the same white dust you've seen
elsewhere in the Temple. There are no decorations, adornments, or carvings
anywhere in sight, although you sense that something dark and evil is to
the south.

     Your attention is immediately drawn to the north where you hear a low
chanting. As you glance in that direction, you see the white marble walls
of the chamber change into yellow crystal. The chamber to the north also
seems to be brighter than the one you are in, almost as if it has a light
source that doesn't reach outside of the room. Otherwise there is nothing
remarkable about the room you are in, save the white dust on the floor.

     The white marble walls of this room are intricately covered with runes
and carvings displaying everything from the construction of the temple to
the coming of the Celestial War. It is almost as if this room serves as the
visual history of the temple. You notice that there is very little space
for any additional events to be chiseled, meaning either the prophets
expect little else to happen or the temple is nearing the end of its
existence. If it is the latter, you can't help but feel that a great
chapter in the realm is coming to a close.

     The walls of the Temple are made from solid white marble here, a
remarkable contrast to the drab brown stone that makes up the exterior of
the temple. The floor is layered with a thin white dust, which you suspect
is the same marble of the walls. On the east wall is the figure of an
Aurinite holding a basket of herbs. On the west wall is a gargoyle, its
claws clutching a small child. It occurs to you for the first time that
every member of each race is necessarily warlike.

     You find yourself at a junction in the corridor. To the north you hear
what sounds like metal being scrapped heavily against stone. It's
impossible to tell how far to the north it is due to the echoes in the
hallway. To the south you can just make out a large chamber in the
distance. To the east you can see the flicker of a torchlight and hear the
laughing of children, an odd sound in the otherwise solemn Temple.

     Set prominently in the north wall is a large torch, its surface alight

transparent crystal, though you can't see through it into any other rooms.
The walls are bare of any decorations save a single symbol below the torch.
Although you cannot tell what language it is, a voice seems to whisper in

     This area looks like a children's' play area. The floor is scattered
with various toys, some resembling Aurinites while others resemble
Gargoyles. The walls have been smeared by what appear to be paints and
dyes, probably in some attempt to decorate the place. As you study the
room, you realize that a mock battle is being played out here between the
two forces.  In the center of the room is a small sword, probably meant to
represent Caliburn, the sword of sacred fires <3d13 hr3 norent tank only w28>.

     The walls of this room seem to have gone completely insane with color.
Whereas the majority of the Temple corridors are subdued in color, here it
looks as though a rainbow exploded. As you walk up to one of the walls and
run your finger along the marble, the color comes off onto your finger. The
more you study the walls, the more it looks as though a collection of
children did this instead of being natural to the Temple. You hear laughter
to the south and smell something faint in the air to the west.

Whereas the majority of the Temple corridors are subdued in color, here it
looks as though a rainbow exploded. As you walk up to one of the walls and
run your finger along the marble, the color comes off onto your finger. The
more you study the walls, the more it looks as though a collection of
children did this instead of being natural to the Temple. You hear laughter
to the south and smell something faint in the air to the west.

     Set prominently in the north wall is a large torch, its surface alight

only it can feel. The walls of this junction are made from an almost
transparent crystal, though you can't see through it into any other rooms.
The walls are bare of any decorations save a single symbol below the torch.
Although you cannot tell what language it is, a voice seems to whisper in

     Two forces seem to collide here. To the east you see nothing but
darkness and black marble walls. To the north is a light from a flickering
torch and nearly transparent crystal walls. The north is also considerably
warmer than the east. The two powers seem to meet in the middle of the room
and cancel each other out in a nearly straight line. Halfway up the wall,
split by the powers of light and dark, is the figure of an owl holding a
sacred sword.

immediately to the south as though it can't progress in that direction.

barren. The walls, floor, and ceiling are a dark brown in color with veins
of green streaming through them. The altar at the far end of the room is
made from a dirty grey stone, its surface covered with specks of black and
brown. Filling the area between you and the altar are a half dozen pews,
each made from what looks like solidified mud. The only decoration in the
room is a mosaic of a white wolf on the wall behind the altar.

[36mAt a Holy Tree[0;37m
     The first thing you notice, and most magnificent item in this room, is
a large oak tree taking up the entire north wall. There is no sign of how
sunlight and water get to the tree, yet it still stands before you
majestically. To the right and left of the tree are two small shrines, both
covered with magenta clothes. The floor beneath your feet is completely
bare of the white dust you've seen everywhere else in the Temple. To the
east you feel a holy presence, as if from a chapel.

[36mThe Celestial Temple[0;37m
     You find yourself at a crossroads in an otherwise nondescript room.
There are no signs telling you what is in each direction, but you
immediately pick up some signs. The dust on the floor to the east seems to
be well passed on. To the south you can see the flicker of a torch set in
the wall. The passage to the west looks like more of the same undecorated
stone as you are currently surrounded by. To the north there is what
appears to be a tree.

     The first thing you notice is the large tracks in the white dust below
your feet. Whereas the rest of the dust in the temple seems to settle as
soon as people pass through it, the dust here has obviously been disturbed
too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high
traffic area, though there is no way to tell why from here. There is a
large granite door to the east, one of only a few in the Temple.

[36mGuardian Chamber[0;37m
     This room, like its three companions, is spartan to the point of
bareness. The walls are plain and undecorated, the floor is covered with a
fine layer of dirt to serve as a carpet of sorts, and there are only two
torches in the room to illuminate it. The wooden furniture looks almost as
though it is about to fall apart, which doesn't really surprise you. As
you turn to leave, you notice a mountainous landscape chiseled above the
door.

     You find yourself at a crossroads in an otherwise nondescript room.
There are no signs telling you what is in each direction, but you
immediately pick up some signs. The dust on the floor to the east seems to
be well passed on. To the south you can see the flicker of a torch set in
the wall. The passage to the west looks like more of the same undecorated
stone as you are currently surrounded by. To the north there is what
appears to be a tree.

     Before you can even look around the room, you feel a shiver run
through your system. It doesn't take long to realize it is the area to the
north that is causing your discomfort. Despite your best efforts, you can't
penetrate the total blackness that sits there like a waiting demon.
Suppressing another shiver, you look around the room. This section of the
Temple is completely nondescript, almost as if people were too scared to
spend much time here.

     Set into the west wall here is a flickering torch made from an almost
black wood. But that isn't what draws your attention, especially since the
remainder of this room is basically spartan. Hanging in the air foot above
your head are three arrows, one pointing towards each of the three exits.
The east arrow has the word "Legends" written on it. The north arrow has
the word "Land." The south arrow has the word "Portal." Obviously this is
an important crossroad in the Temple.

     The walls here are lined with an uncountable number of pots and vases,
all of them without decoration. The pots are stacked, reaching up to the
ceiling. Only a handful of the pots aren't covered, and those that are are
probably locked up tight with magic or other means. Inside the open pots
you can see old, tattered scrolls. There are no pieces of furniture or
decorations in the room, making you think this is simply a storage room.

     The walls here are lined with an uncountable number of pots and vases,
all of them without decoration. The pots are stacked, reaching up to the
ceiling. Only a handful of the pots aren't covered, and those that are are
probably locked up tight with magic or other means. Inside the open pots
you can see old, tattered scrolls. There are no pieces of furniture or

directly into the east wall instead of standing alone. The room is heavily
decorated with images of gargoyles and Aurinites, though none of them are
armed with weaponry. The more you study the carvings, the more it looks
like the two races are living peacefully. You suspect these were chiseled
centuries ago, well before the Celestial War began.

raging on the floors above. The walls here are also completely plain, the
dust on the floor undisturbed by time or even your footsteps. For some

     The carvings here seem to be more scrawlings that anything else,
almost as if a child had done them. High on the wall, higher than any child
could reach, is the barren Celestial Valley before the Temple was built on
it. Below that is a race of dwarf-like creatures carrying equipment into
the valley. Near the bottom is the half finished Temple. It occurs to you
that the large Temple drawn here is considerably larger than what you can
see of the Temple outside, almost as if the valley is trying to reclaim its
lost lands.

looks like the arrival of the two armies to the Temple. Near the top are
the two kings engaged in battle. Below them are the two armies engaged in
the deadliest of combat. There looks to have been something below that, but
it has since been lost to the sands of time.

Standing at the top of the wall wrapped in strands of silver energy is the
druid caught in his final spell. Below him are the two armies, each

Celestial Valley slowly recovering from the war that raged across it.

like large crystal being, which you assumed to be Aurinites. But they
aren't wielding weapons, they aren't wearing armor, and they aren't drilling
for battle. They appear to be farming, playing music, and building houses,
nothing you would expect from a race with a military reputation. Set off in

figures are the same. Some are very young, some are smaller and thinner,
and some are the large knights you know of. As you scan the walls, you
can't help but notice how awkward the Aurinites looks with the weapons and
armor they are wielding, almost as if they are just learning how to use
them. It occurs to you to look down and you see three women, one in a grey
robe, one in a black robe (mage hide), one in a white robe (just a white robe ac-3 *19), standing near a cauldron.
Somehow you think they are teaching the Aurinites how to fight.

of the temple and the half dozen pews between you and it are made from a
solid white crystal and seems to be hanging in midair. The only true

     Surrounding you on the walls are carved figures of crystal, which you
assumed to be the Aurinites. They all are wearing armor, wielding weapons,
and obviously preparing for war. Standing off to one side is an Aurinite
much large than the rest having a consultation with three women in three
different colored robes. They appear to be instructing the Aurinite, though
in what you can only guess. There are no children or other women in the
scene, but you suspect they must be nearby.

     Upon entering this area of the Temple, you stop suddenly and feel your
mouth dropping open. Painted in vibrant colors on the walls are what look
like large crystal being, which you assumed to be Aurinites. But they
aren't wielding weapons, they aren't wearing armor, and they aren't drilling
for battle. They appear to be farming, playing music, and building houses,
nothing you would expect from a race with a military reputation. Set off in
the distance you can see three figures, in three different colored robes,
seemingly walking toward the village.

     The white marble walls of this room are intricately covered with runes
and carvings displaying everything from the construction of the temple to
the coming of the Celestial War. It is almost as if this room serves as the
visual history of the temple. You notice that there is very little space
for any additional events to be chiseled, meaning either the prophets
expect little else to happen or the temple is nearing the end of its
existence. If it is the latter, you can't help but feel that a great

remarkable contrast to the drab brown stone that makes up the exterior of
the temple. The floor is layered with a thin white dust, which you suspect
is the same marble of the walls. On the east wall is the figure of an
Aurinite holding a basket of herbs. On the west wall is a gargoyle, its
claws clutching a small child. It occurs to you for the first time that
every member of each race is necessarily warlike.

of red crystal and dark stone that streak through them. As you trace the
lines of crystal and stone along the wall, you notice that they appear to
be streaming down from the ceiling above you, almost like blood trickling

you shudder involuntarily. How much killing would have to occur to make it

[36mThe Celestial Temple[0;37m
     The first thing you notice is the large tracks in the white dust below
your feet. Whereas the rest of the dust in the temple seems to settle as
soon as people pass through it, the dust here has obviously been disturbed
too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high
traffic area, though there is no way to tell why from here. There is a
large oaken door to the north, one of only a few in the Temple.

[36mGuardian Chamber[0;37m
     This room, like its three companions, is spartan to the point of
bareness. The walls are plain and undecorated, the floor is covered with a
fine layer of dirt to serve as a carpet of sorts, and there are only two
torches in the room to illuminate it. The wooden furniture looks almost as
thought it is about to fall apart, which doesn't really surprise you. As
you turn to leave, you notice a large flaming sun chiseled above the door.

     This room, like its three companions, is spartan to the point of
bareness. The walls are plain and undecorated, the floor is covered with a
fine layer of dirt to serve as a carpet of sorts, and there are only two
torches in the room to illuminate it. The wooden furniture looks almost as
thought it is about to fall apart, which doesn't really surprise you. As
you turn to leave, you notice a large flaming sun chiseled above the door.

     The first thing you notice is the large tracks in the white dust below
your feet. Whereas the rest of the dust in the temple seems to settle as
soon as people pass through it, the dust here has obviously been disturbed
too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high
traffic area, though there is no way to tell why from here. There is a
large oaken door to the north, one of only a few in the Temple.

entrance. There are obvious signs of the Celestial War marring the
otherwise pristine walls of the temple, but no breaks that would indicate a
way in. In a sudden rush of fear, it occurs to you that the entrance might
be locked forever underneath the rock which covers the rest of the temple.
There appears to be the outline of a door here, but you can't be sure.

     Although the broken and rusted piece of equipment scattered here draw
your attention immediately, your mind eventually focuses on the large pit
immediately to the south. It takes up most of the area to the south and
prevents you from moving in that direction. Glancing over the edge of the
pit, you see a collection of sharp spear point up at you from three meters
below. Given the bits of canvas and dried leaves littering the bottom of
the pit, this was obviously once used as a trap, though which side
constructed it is anybody's guess.

     Like most of the valley, this area is full of broken equipment and
rusted metal, none of it useful anymore. What strikes you, though, is a
collection of ten deep grooves in the ground running from east to west.
Kneeling down to get a better look at them, and coughing momentarily from
the dust kicked up around you, you tentatively place your hand over the
indentations. Although your fingers don't fit perfectly into the grooves,
it is easily conceivable that the fingers of a creature the size of an
Aurinite or Gargoyle could. Obviously someone was dragged through this area
against their will, possibly to the large pit you see to the west.

     Dug into the center of this section of the valley is a spacious pit,
though there doesn't appear to be anyway to climb down into it and still be
able to climb back out. Looking down into it you see it's about half full
with broken down, rusted, and useless equipment from the Celestial War.
Obviously this place is an equipment dump for someone. The question is, why
would anyone gather this unusable equipment in one place? Littering its rim
are stacks of dirt, obviously the ground displaced to dig the pit, and
short stacks of rusted out equipment that have yet to be dumped into it.

     There are two large indentations along the dust covered ground here,
not big enough to be caused by a machine of war, but definitely not
natural. As you lean down to examine them closer, coughing once at the dust
hanging in the air around you, you notice that the grooves are identical in
length and width. You slump your shoulders in concentration, wondering what
could cause such markings, when it suddenly dawns on you. From what you
know of the size of the Gargoyles and Aurinites, they are what would happen
if a soldier who was shoved forcibly into the ground and slid for several
feet, his shoulder blades digging into the ground as he moved.

who originally erected it is a mystery. It appears to made from solid
granite, at least on this side. As you run your hands along the almost
frictionless surface, your discover that the block turns to crystal halfway
along each side. Gazing atop the statue, you see the figure of a large
Gargoyle, his wings spread outward in a battle pose, staring down at you.
There looks to be a second figure standing back-to-back with the Gargoyle,
but you can't tell from this side. Nor can you easily go around the statue

[36mEdge of the Celestial Valley[0;37m
     As you scan the valley walls here, you can't help but notice a series
of random and almost frantic grooves cut into the stone to the south. At
first you think they might be someone's failed attempt at a message, but
their grim reality quickly sets in. The grooves can only be from the gloved
hand of a soldier trying desperately to claw his way up the wall and
probably failing miserably. There are no signs of a body or blood, making
you think that whatever finally happened to the soldier, it didn't happen
here. The valley walls prevent you from moving to the south or east, but
the field of battle continues joylessly to the north and west. There
appears to be a stone block immediately north.

[36mExit from the Celestial Valley[0;37m
     Almost as your feet touch the floor of the valley, you feel the air
begin to weigh heavily in your lungs. The odor of centuries old magic and
decades old battles hangs around you like an oppressive blanket. The ground
beneath your feet is a lifeless color, everything that once grew here
having been crushed into oblivion under soldiers' feet years earlier. As
you shuffle your feet to get a better look around, the dust you kick up
begins to mix with the death in the air. The valley walls block your exit
to the west, but the field of battle continues to the east and north. There
appears to be a crystal block immediately north.

[36mNear the Edge of the Cliff[0;37m
     As you suspected earlier the cliff drops off into a small valley, but
that supposition couldn't have prepared you for what lies within that
valley. Jutting out from beneath the far wall of the valley is the edge of
a building, made from the same stone as the valley walls. You suspect that
it goes much further into the wall, but can't be sure from this distance.
Lying between you and that building is a large field, which looks as though
a war once raged upon it. There are signs of a barricade to your right, a
rock slide to the left, and various pits and traps in between. With sudden
abruptness you realize you are standing on the cliff the young druid
sacrificed his life upon in a final spell to end the Celestial War. Surely
the building hidden under the valley wall must be the Celestial Temple he
was trying to protect.

[36mAtop a Small Cliff[0;37m
     The air here seems somewhat fresher than on the other side of the
Celestial Gate, but it is tinged with the scent of wizardry and warcraft.
It doesn't take long to realize you are atop a cliff, though its edge is
immediately to the north. You cannot see what lies beyond from where you
are, but it looks to drop off suddenly into a small valley. Although you
feel a sense of wariness, you cannot locate the source of your discomfort
until you realize how quiet it is. Pausing momentarily, you realize there
are no signs or sounds of life anywhere nearby. It's as if all the life in
the area has been swept away by some giant hand.

[36mAt the Celestial Gate[0;37m
     The path comes to a sudden end here, the path to the north occupied by
a large granite and crystal gate. The only direction available to you is
back to the south since the areas to the east and west are blocked by large
boulders. As you examine the boulders closer, you can almost see the
outlines of various arms, legs, heads, and other body parts. Just as you
begin to wonder if your eyes are failing you, you feel an unseen force
tempting you to enter the gate to the north.

     You find yourself at a sudden crossroads of sorts along the dirt path.
To the east and west are two small huts, both made from a magenta plant
that obviously dried out years ago. You find it peculiar that you failed to
notice the huts earlier, but then you notice the collection of large rocks,
some crystal, some granite, stacked up on the southern edges of the huts.
You begin to realize that those are the small towers you saw earlier. There
is a pulsing of energy to the north.

     This dirt path is unremarkable in every respect. There are no tracks
of any animals ground into the loose dirt. There are no plants growing
within the confines of the path, though they grow plentifully on either
side. And there is no sign of the path needing grooming of any kind. Oddly,
the path doesn't even need repair after you walk along it, as if it is
impossible to tarnish its unremarkable appearance. To the north you see
what look like two small towers made of granite and crystal, each
positioned on either side of the path.

     Although the underbrush and trees continue to grow carelessly
throughout this area, the path below your feet catches your attention. It
appears to have been carefully cut through this area and rigorously
maintained over the years. You can't remember when the path began, but you
feel certain it wasn't at the two monuments you can still see to the south.
The sound of a stream is still present in the distant, but most of its
music has been swallowed by the trees around you. The path continues to the
west.

[36mBetween Two Monuments[0;37m
     On either side of the path, hidden behind two short trees so they
can't be clearly seen from the stream, are two stone monuments. The
monument to the left is of a solitary man, his face shrouded by his cloak,
leaning gently on a walking staff. A small owl is perched on his right
shoulder. The monument to the right looks to be a simple block of granite,
but you sense it is more than that. Stepping closer, you see what appear to
be shatter marks in the otherwise pristine stone. Laying atop the granite
block is what appears to be a mold for the blade and hilt of a sword. The
trees and grass here is severely overgrown, making you wonder when the last
time someone was through this area.

remains of a path. The trees and grass on either side of the path have
obviously been trying to wash away its existence for some time and appear
to be succeeding. The path is all but obscured by the weeds growing in it.
The path appears to continue to the north, but it is hard to tell from
here. To the south you hear the trickle of the stream.

    This road weaves its way through the Vingaard Mountains through the
only known pass. At its southern end is the High Clerists Tower. From there
it leads north to the jewel of Solamnia, the city of Palanthas. The road
continues to the north and south.

[36mNearing the Walls of the High Clerist Tower[0;37m
    Approaching the massive High Clerist Tower, it is obvious that this
fort is enormous. Designed to protect the Vingaard mountains, the tower is
situated to block the westgate pass. Additions to the walls around the
tower have totally blocked off the passage. The main tower and walls seem
to be quite old, built decades ago.

    The northern portcullis of the High Clerist Tower lies to the south,
allowing access through the main wall to the tower courtyard, but still
providing defense when needed. A small cobblestone path leads off to the
east, leading around the main walls of the tower. The main road through the
pass continues to the north, and off to the south through the tower
courtyard.

    The path around the massive walls of the tower is, in reality, little
more than a small goat trail. The Vingaard mountains encroach upon the
walls, leaving just a few feet of clearance between the walls and the stone
face of the mountain. Although it is possible to squeeze along the walls,
the narrow passageway might not be the safest way to go. A few cobblestones
still remain from the path that went around the tower, but the path has
been blocked off by the additions to the towers defensive walls.

to pass through. Several sets of footprints, visible in the dirt here, lead
through the opening here, showing that this passage is still traveled.

    Looking to the west, a massive stone wall blocks the pass, leaving few
options for movement here. The narrowness of the trail leaves very little
room for maneuvering, and would make a great place for an ambush. The
original highway around the tower has completely fallen apart, the only
remains are several stones in the ground, broken to pieces over time. A
small group of knights can be heard from the ramparts overhead, talking as
they patrol the walls.

possible precursor for things to come. The defenders of the tower can be
heard overhead, marching along the ramparts, ready for battle.

faithful stand on the walls, the tower shall not fall. Eastwards lies a

    Directly to the north, the High Clerist Tower rises skyward, reaching
higher than any other structure on Krynn. The tower, an ancient bastion of
the Solamnic Knighthood, stands just to the side of Westgate pass. The
Knight's Spur, a much more recent addition, stretches out across the
northern exit of the pass, protecting the city of Palanthas that lies
beyond. A few snow-capped peaks of the Vingaard Mountains can be seen in
the distance, their impressive heights dwarfed by the massive tower. To the
south, the road leads back down to the plains through the mountains.

    Stretching out from horizon to horizon, the Knights' High Road passes
through the Solamnic Plain, connecting the city of Vingaard with the lord
city of Palanthas. The shining jewel of Solamnia, Palanthas lies far to the
west and north, beyond Westgate Pass in the Vingaard Mountains, while the
city of Vingaard lies east-south-east of here. The tall grasses of the
plains seem to go on forever, gently swaying back and forth with the
breeze. Barely visible far to the west are a few mountain peaks.

    You travel along a very long road, extending as far as you can see
through the seemingly endless Solamnic Plain. The road is wide and
obviously heavily used, though some tracks seem a bit old. The occasional
bird flies high overhead, quietly cruising around searching for prey. A
light breeze blows, carrying the sweet smell of the plains with it. The
road extends west-northwest toward Palanthas and east-southeast to
Vingaard, its keep perched atop a hill barely visible on the horizon.

    The Knights' High Road ends here, just west of the city of Vingaard.
The city's massive town wall surrounds the city just to the northeast,
while perched atop a hill to the southeast is the main keep, an impressive
fortification. Large swatches of fertile farmlands surround the town, and a
small road leads off to the north through them. Directly to the east is a
small two-story stone structure, the tollhouse, used to collect taxes from
people passing through the area.

    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

visible perched atop a hill with the city's walls nearby. The road

[36mThe West Bank[0;37m
    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

    The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal
place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,
scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

[36mA Highway Through the Plains[0;37m
    Winding its way through the windy and fertile Plains, the highway
stretches to the east and to the west, escaping the horizon. Quiet and
depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the highway, their
heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the
highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and weeds.
The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire. To the
south, a large mountain range rises through the sky. Most of the mountains
appear jagged and snow-capped.

this small trail slowly ascends upwards as its plunges into the snowy and
rugged Garnet Mountains.  The mountains are said to be the home of the
dwarven nation of Garnet, enemies of the highlord and Lemish.  The
vegetation thins out as you travel away from the plains and into the

    A large, underground road slices through the Garnet Mountains here. The

Every so often, then tunnel turns into a small hall, carved with fine
precision and intended to make the road more comfortable to travel. The
halls are relatively short and you are forced to duck in some areas.

    A large, underground road slices through the Garnet Mountains here. The
road is more of a large tunnel, carved by the efforts of several thousand
dwarves over a relatively short period of time. Caked in the walls of the
tunnel are several large stones, all glowing and radiating a comfy warmth.
Every so often, then tunnel turns into a small hall, carved with fine
precision and intended to make the road more comfortable to travel. The
halls are relatively short and you are forced to duck in some areas.

     The tunnel opens up into a large rock garden.  The garden is huge and
hypnotic to look at.  Stones of every size and color are lined up in small
rows inbetween cobblestone paths.  The gardens make a large sqaure, with
all paths eventually reacthing the center of the square.  In the center,
there is a large plant, its flowers wide open.  Looking up, you notice that
there is a small stream of sunlight coming in from a hole in the ceiling.
The garden is quite peaceful.

     The tunnels here continue to wind through the vast Garnet mountains

common tunnels, the various streets that lead through the residential

the homes of the Garnet dwarves, you really do not want to get the eight
dwarven guards standing near the entrance mad with your demands; they won't
let you pass anyways.

     At one time, this small tunnel connected to the large network of
tunnels that made up the legendary mines of Garnet.  The King, on his
weekly visits to inspect iron ore and gold production, would decend down a
large stone staircase here.  Unfortunately, the costly war with Lemish and
the fear of invasion somehow from below has forced the dwarves to close
down the entrance. Several boulders and other objects block passage down,
into the mines.

     Unlike the rough halls of the city above, the halls here are quite
smooth. A lot of time was spent by the dwarves here to remove all the rough
edges and stoney fissure that made travel in the tunnels above sometimes
hard.  The tunnel can be considered more of a hall; its tall, square shape
is a welcome sight to you.  Several torches are embedded along the wall,
radiating a large quantity of light.  Every once-in-a-while a statue has
been carved into the walls of the hall.  The statues are quite detailed.

     Unlike the rough halls of the city above, the halls here are quite
smooth. A lot of time was spent by the dwarves here to remove all the rough
edges and stoney fissure that made travel in the tunnels above sometimes
hard.  The tunnel can be considered more of a hall; its tall, square shape
is a welcome sight to you.  Several torches are embedded along the wall,
radiating a large quantity of light.  Every once-in-a-while a statue has
been carved into the walls of the hall.  The statues are quite detailed.

[36mTunnel to the Palace[0;37m
     Not having a real name, the tunnel that leads from the main part of
Garnet into the palace is rather regal.  Carved into the walls, in between
patches of glowing gems, are statues representing dwarven heroes and kings
of Garnet.  The tunnel is rather large, much taller then the average dwarf.
Over the years, the dwarves here have hosted many diplomatic visitors,
espcially from Palanthas and the High Clerist Tower.  The excavation of the
tunnel is flawless in all regards, testiment to the precision  of the
dwarves here.

     The tunnel opens up into a large rock garden.  The garden is huge and
hypnotic to look at.  Stones of every size and color are lined up in small
rows in between cobblestone paths.  The gardens make a large square, with
all paths eventually reaching the center of the square.  In the center,
there is a large plant, its flowers wide open.  It does appear that
a small stream of sunlight could come in from a hole in the ceiling.
The garden is quite peaceful.

Every so often, then tunnel turns into a small hall, carved with fine
precision and intended to make the road more comfortable to travel. The
halls are relatively short and you are forced to duck in some areas.

     Branching off from the main road that runs through southern Solamnia,
this small trail slowly ascends upwards as its plunges into the snowy and
rugged Garnet Mountains.  The mountains are said to be the home of the
dwarven nation of Garnet, enemies of the highlord and Lemish.  The
vegetation thins out as you travel away from the plains and into the
mountains.  Occasionally, you spot a few mountain animals here and there.
You hope that these shy creatures are the only ones inhabiting the
snow-topped peaks.

    Magnificent gates represent the entrance to the city of Lytburg. To the
east and west, tall spires house the city's guards, who stare out the
windows at the horizon. Listening intently, you can hear the city bustling
with activity, as weary travellers make this a frequent stop. A small path
leads eastward and westward along the walls, around the city.

elaborately decorated archway opens up into the heart of the city to the
south.

assembled walls, a chair and a cot. An open pit in the center of the room
contains ashes long grown cold, as its tender was likely conscripted to
serve in the infantry versus the vile oppressors who have laid siege to this
town. The contrast between the towering white pillars that majestically
identify the town and the poor surroundings you currently see is stark and
depressing.

    The pristine cobblestones of Kharas Avenue that were the trademark of
Lytburg are mirrored here, yet so worn and aged it's hard to believe they
are actually part of the same town. The grit of battle and preparation have
stinted the beauty of the side streets and back alleys that have been
neglected by haste and negligence. Away from the bustling marketplace, this
is the first indication that all is not well in the town of Lytburg.

    A poor excuse for a hovel, this one room consists of four crudely
assembled walls, a chair and a cot. An open pit in the center of the room
contains ashes long grown cold, as its tender was likely conscripted to
serve in the infantry versus the vile oppressors who have laid siege to this
town. The contrast between the towering white pillars that majestically
identify the town and the poor surroundings you currently see is stark and
depressing.

contains ashes long grown cold, as its tender was likely conscripted to
serve in the infantry versus the vile oppressors who have laid siege to this

identify the town and the poor surroundings you currently see is stark and

is the first indication that all is not well in the town of Lytburg.

    Leatherworkers and armourers work side by side, frantically patching
chainmail that is horrifyingly and obviously second-hand. How they acquire
their raw materials is hardly a mystery as you note bloodstains and bits of
flesh being scrubbed by small children behind the stalls. Patched armor is
better than running off to battle in nothing better than smallclothes,
however, and conscripts vye for even the poorest specimen the "craftsmen"
have to offer.

[36mThe Northern Gates of Lytburg[0;37m
    Magnificent gates represent the entrance to the city of Lytburg. To the
east and west, tall spires house the city's guards, who stare out the
windows at the horizon. Listening intently, you can hear the city bustling
with activity, as weary travellers make this a frequent stop. A small path
leads eastward and westward along the walls, around the city.

[36mTravelling The Plains[0;37m
    The plains get vaster as you delve deeper into them. Though mostly
composed of weed, an occasional farmer can be seen tilling the land and
nurturing his crops. Off in the distance, towards the east, thick columns
of smoke rise into the air, giving signs of a recent battle. The road is
hard and well-travelled. To the east you hear the sound of running water,
of a fast flowing river.

a slightly sweet smell with it. The road extends south toward Solanthus and

    The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal
place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,
scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

[36mThe West Bank[0;37m
    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,

[36mThe Vingaard River[0;37m
    The clear waters of the Vingaard River gently flow northward, toward
Kalaman and the Northern Courrain Ocean. The river is fairly wide though
seems a bit narrower in this area, likely the reason a ferry was set up
here. Light shimmers off the water, dancing about the irregularities in the
water's usually smooth surface. A few fish can barely be seen swimming
about.

small section of the building's roof extends out over the road to serve as

waters of the Vingaard, a series of cleats along its edges to tie up the
ferry.

walls run north and south from here, extending quite a ways before turning
beyond your vision. A stone highway leads east through the Solamnic plains
and a cobblestone avenue heads west through the gates.

    The highway runs alongside the west bank of the Vingaard River, below
the high walls of the city itself. The road is heavily rutted as much
traffic passes through the area, and the proximity to the river moistens
the ground. To the west lies a small tollhouse, used in days past to
collect taxes from travellers passing through. Northward the road heads to
the east gate of Vingaard City, and to a ferry crossing the river.

road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

[36mThe West Bank[0;37m
    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

    Waves from the Newsea crash onto the shoreline, sending spray of salty

kick sand and water droplets into your face. From the eastern horizon to
the western horizon, all that can be seen are the waters of the Newsea.
Directly across the waters to the north you can barely make out a land mass
and a city, it must be Port o'Call. The sand along the shore becomes more
sparse to the south and a road leads away from the shoreline.

[36mSouthern Avenue[0;37m
    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

foundation of the structure, keeping it a safe distance from the raging
waters below. Even from here, you can hear the roar from the river below as
it crashes into the pillars and is forced around them. The stone bridge
stretches northward, high above the river, but the southern bank is still
reassuringly nearby.

     You stand at the south end of a mighty stone bridge.  Below, a very
large and swift flowing river roars down towards the New Sea.  The river
is quite dangerous and only the largest of ferries are capable of being
able to properly navigate it.  The bridge itself is wide and is one of
the most impressive feats of dwarven craftsmanship that you have ever
seen.  You can also just make out a path that leads down to a stone dock
from here.

    A raised road leads across the bog to the south and to the west. The
road has been built up with various materials to accommodate the travellers
of this region. The bog can be seen in all directions from here, the only
thing to save you from it is the road. To the distant north you see some
foothills slowly growing smaller and fading into the flat plains of
Dergoth. The eastern arm of the Kharolis mountains can be seen far off to
the west.

the west. The road has been built up with stones, wood and dirt to maintain
a stable platform for travellers. Its not a work of art but it does the

    Before you stand two huge brass gates which once guarded the entrance
to Thorbardin. However, a terrible earthquake has caused the passageway
beyond the gates to collapse, sealing off the entrance forever. The giant
gates have fallen off their hinges and lean forlornly against the piles of
rubble. Although the passage into the kingdom is destroyed, the indomitable
mountain known as Cloudseeker still stands, reaching towards the sky. To

    The passage way between the mountain walls and the piles of boulders
is just wide enough for a fair-size adventuring party to pass through. The
boulders look unsteady and you would hate to have to climb up on them, but
thankfully don't look like there will be an avalanche. To the north, the
path opens up and you can see a set of ruined gates, while to the south,
the tight passageway continues through the barren mountain range.

dwarves swing steel picks high over their heads and crash them down into the

The forests to the west are made up of thousands of tall oaks, their
branches spreading outwards in a glorious canopy. This forest is the
boundary of the Qualinesti elves, their capitol Qualinost somewhere in the
northern parts. The road south leads eventually to the Kharolis Mountains
and on south to Tarsis.

    The Stope is quite narrow and tall. The ancient miners mined as much of
the precious metal as they could without having the roof collapse on them.
A smaller stope has been burrowed to the north off the western stope. The
timbers seem soggy here and are likely to collapse at any point.

[36mThe Fault[0;37m
    The rock type seems to change instantly here. A large fault runs
vertically up both sides of the tunnel. The rich ore veins end suddenly and
in their place, limestone occurs. This must have frustrated the ancient
miners to no end, and you can imagine why this stope was abandoned. The
stope leads to a chamber to the west and the dark mine is east.

[36mThe Pool[0;37m
    The walls of the mine seem to be receeding at this point. Timber stands
up at least several feet from the walls and forms a bizarre framework. The
acidic mine waters are eating away at the rock faces, which seem to be much
different from the dark ore-bearing rock of the rest of the mine. Large
pieces of limestone litter the floor and the sound of dripping water can be
heard echoing throughout the chamber. You see a small pool of acrid water
with water slowly dripping into it from above.

of Solace clustered in Solace Vale. The Solace River is merely a streak of

forests and puffs of smoke can be seen where the town of Longridge stands.
Glancing south, the mysterious forest of Darken Wood stands with its fabled
woodland creatures. The path you are on leads down the hill to the south
and into the foothills to the west.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

     You are on the rough waters of Newsea. The weather is harsh and the
sky is gloomy. It is very tough to navigate through the turbulent waters,
large waves and strong winds seem to cover much of this sea. The waters
here seems unnaturally dark, and you see few signs of sea life.

    The yellowish sands seamlessly slope into the waters of Newsea as the
waters ebb and flow along the shoreline. The sounds of the sea rhythmically
wash alongst the shore, offering a consistent melody. The caw of sea birds
can be heard before they are seen, taking off and landing atop the waters
to the west. The sandy beach leads eastwards and comes to a trailhead,
leading through some verdant rolling hills. The sky is partially cloudy,
and a drizzle of rain can be felt from time to time.

staining the sand with moisture. Far to the southeast, beyond the hills,
the terrain opens up into a vast desert known as the Plains of Dust. There
is almost a distinguishable line where the sands from the plains meets the
grass at the edge of the hills. The sun warms the hills, but some light

known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.

careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only
option is to continue either north or south.

    The narrow road twists and winds around the larger foothills here.
These hills are the southern extent of the mightly Khalkist Mountains which
loom over you to the north. The peaks are such a bleak, dark grey, they
almost look charred against the sky. To the south the rocky road flattens
somewhat into more hilly foothills while those to the north only become
more treacherous and rocky. In the distance you can see faint signs of
smoke barely rising above the foothills far to the southwest.

spring from the earth as the cold, snowy peaks of the Khalkists spring up
around you. Gazing to the west you notice a huge column of black smoke
rising into the air.  Occasionally the ground here shakes almost
imperceptibly, trembling in response to the volcano in the distance.  
The road is barely visible now, as sheer walls of rock flanking the

    The lands of Ak-Tubal and Kalin Ak-Phan stretch out to the east. They
are flat, dry, grassy plains infamous for their unbearable heat during the
summer solstice. Although the conditions can be harsh, you can see several
clumps of hardwoods providing some shade for travellers. Far east beyond
the huge plains you can barely make out the glittering waves of the Khurman
Sea. The altitude descends north of there, though to the south you can see
the jagged, towering peaks of the mighty Khalkist Mountains.

    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

[36mThe Main Lift[0;37m
    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

[36mBottom of the Main Lift[0;37m
    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of
the mountain above. Complicated gears and pulleys seem to work together in
an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

[36mThe Entrance to Deep Mine[0;37m
    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large

very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

Even though it seems that the dwarves would have attempted to kill the
gnomish desire to speak very quickly, these dwarves have more or less
reverted to gnomishness. The inventors walk about in purple robes which
drag along the ground. Junked and new contraptions lie all over the ground,
however any clear purpose to them, is lost in the extensive machinery. The
path east leads closer towards the Engineering Guild, while the path west

seem to have been given to regular villagers. Miners walk in groups, while
a little lass with short whiskers can be seen carrying home some groceries.
Dwarven children, who have not yet begun education in any of the principle

carts. The path south leads to a junction in the Main Way, while to the

    The home of the Pyromancers looms before you. While quite an impressive
structure, it is very noticeably not the largest of the guilds in Deep
Mine. Whispers in the street suggest that this maybe the source of some
minor animosity between the Miners and Pyromancers. Of course, it is clear
the village could not maintain its success with only one of the guilds so
the two guilds maintain a level commonly referred to as "Tolerance". The
guild itself is very plain, in sharp contrast to the ornate Mining Guild.
Black or darkly colored curtains cover the windows of the Guild,
emphasizing the secrecy of the pyromancers. Explosions ring and shake the
rock structures yet it still seems very, very sturdy where it lies. A guard
post has been erected outside the guild, however the guards within it do
not appear to be pyromancers. The Pyromancers Guild lies to the south,
while to the north the tunnel leads away from the Guild.

    A single lantern hanging from the ceiling, dimly lights the slender
tunnel, in a sickly green. Other than robed pyromancers, sporting
pleasantly singed robes, the tunnel seems deserted compared to the bustle
of the Main Way. Obviously, the pyromancers are quite secretive about their
craft and art. The tunnel continues to the south here leading right up to
the guild, while the way east leads back toward the Main Way. Explosions,
some soft and some loud are quite commonly heard here.

    The main tunnel of Deep Mine reaches an intersection here. A large sign
on the northern wall labels the intersection with a large number five. Deep
treads in the ground act as tracks for mining carts. The tracks go in all
directions of the tunnel, however the path to the east seems slightly more
used by mining carts. Hanging heavy lanterns, which give off a pretty
orange flame, light the intersection.

indicative of the heavy mine carts regularly traveling through the
underground village. Avoiding the path of the mine carts, villagers stick
to the side of the tunnels. There is plenty of room for everyone in the

    The main tunnel of Deep Mine reaches an intersection here. A large sign
on the northern wall labels the intersection with a large number five. Deep
treads in the ground act as tracks for mining carts. The tracks go in all
directions of the tunnel, however the path to the east seems slightly more
used by mining carts. Hanging heavy lanterns, which give off a pretty
orange flame, light the intersection.

    The facade of the Dwarven Mining Guild is quite impressive. Intricately
carved statues of dwarven miners jut out of the solid rock of which the
guild is cut from. Emeralds, rubies, amethysts, and topazes are encrusted
within the rock, dandifying the already flamboyant display. The tunnel
expands before the guild in almost a large forum. Some miners are visiting
the variety of food stalls set up outside of the guild, taking a quick
break in their days work, while others lean against the building chatting
over new drilling techniques. The guild stands three stories tall, as noted
by the hollowed out rock holes, which serve as windows. To the east lies
the entry hall of the prosperous guild, while the path to the south takes
you away from it.

    The entry hall of the guild is much plainer than the gaudy exterior. In
fact from the look of it, the interior of the guild in general has the more
traditional severity associated with a group of manual labor workers.
Propped against the northern wall is a small chair, perfect for dozing.
Tracks for mining carts lead all the way to the eastern edge of the room,
where there is a circle, allowing the carts to turn around, once unloading
or loading supplies and goods. A few dwarves steadily watch the incoming
and out going carts. The exit of the guild lies directly to the west, while
in the eastern direction the guild continues.

standard of materials for processing. Over twenty desks are set up as
examination stations. When a piece is examined properly, the examiners seem
to pleasantly place them in miniature carts on rollers, which when filled are
moved south into the processing halls. However, in the rare moments when
the raw materials are not up to snuff, a snarl can be seen on the examiners

Some of the samples which come in here are still uncut, so a large part of
the gem process is properly cutting the uncut stones. Each of the gem-
processors, who sit at their individual desks, could probably pass as
exceptional jewelers anywhere else in the world. To the east is a large

    The precious metals region of the processing hall is loaded with veins
of gold and silver taken directly out of the mines. The processing of the
precious metals is much more meticulously watched. Tiny hammers with
blunted heads are strewn all about. Clearly, the processors of precious
metals do not wish to damage their products at all. To the south lies gem
processing, while to the east lies metal processing. The western wall nests
a spectacular collection of precious metals.

    The processing hall is split up into three major sections: metals,
precious metals, and gems. This area must be the metals area. At the many
processing stations dwarves labor over the extraction of mithril and steel
alloys, as well as natural metals, namely copper and iron. Processed metals
seem to end up against the southern wall. To the west the processing hall
continues, while to the north lies the ore grade determination area.

    Heaps and heaps of rawly mined materials enter from the mining carts to
the west. Here, they are examined to see if they meet the guilds high
standard of materials for processing. Over twenty desks are set up as
examination stations. When a piece is examined properly, the examiners seem
to pleasantly place them in miniature carts on rollers, which when filled are
moved south into the processing halls. However, in the rare moments when
the raw materials are not up to snuff, a snarl can be seen on the examiners
face as he hurls it against the northern wall. A small pile of the rubble
lies here, ready to be returned to the depths of the mountain.

    The entry hall of the guild is much plainer than the gaudy exterior. In
fact from the look of it, the interior of the guild in general has the more
traditional severity associated with a group of manual labor workers.
Propped against the northern wall is a small chair, perfect for dozing.
Tracks for mining carts lead all the way to the eastern edge of the room,
where there is a circle, allowing the carts to turn around, once unloading
or loading supplies and goods. A few dwarves steadily watch the incoming
and out going carts. The exit of the guild lies directly to the west, while
in the eastern direction the guild continues.

[36mOutside the Dwarven Miner's Guild[0;37m
    The facade of the Dwarven Mining Guild is quite impressive. Intricately
carved statues of dwarven miners jut out of the solid rock of which the
guild is cut from. Emeralds, rubies, amethysts, and topazes are encrusted
within the rock, dandifying the already flamboyant display. The tunnel
expands before the guild in almost a large forum. Some miners are visiting
the variety of food stalls set up outside of the guild, taking a quick
break in their days work, while others lean against the building chatting
over new drilling techniques. The guild stands three stories tall, as noted
by the hollowed out rock holes, which serve as windows. To the east lies
the entry hall of the prosperous guild, while the path to the south takes
you away from it.

    Lit by torches clamped against the walls of the tunnel, the path here
is not quite as wide or as tall as the Deep Mine Main Way. However, the
spacing is still ample. Many mining carts wheel past, heading both towards
and away from the great dwarven mining guild at the end of this tunnel.
Dwarven mining apprentices in their young years gather in this area,
chattering excitedly. The path leads north towards the guild and west to

    The main tunnel of Deep Mine reaches an intersection here. A large sign
on the northern wall labels the intersection with a large number five. Deep
treads in the ground act as tracks for mining carts. The tracks go in all
directions of the tunnel, however the path to the east seems slightly more

    Bright torches, mounted near the ceiling, light the regularly used
tunnel. Huge tread marks have permanently set themselves in the ground,
indicative of the heavy mine carts regularly traveling through the
underground village. Avoiding the path of the mine carts, villagers stick
to the side of the tunnels. There is plenty of room for everyone in the
region as the tunnel maintains its steady width of at least six minotaurs
and height of four. The tunnel leads to both the north and east. In both
directions lie Junctions in the tunnel system of Deep Mine.

Orange-flamed torches hinged against the western wall light the junction

    Dancing orange flames from torches mounted near the ceiling, brightly
color this tunnel far below the earth. Being the principle tunnel of the
village, its width and height can easily clear the consciousness of
thousands of tons of rock above. Deep treads in the ground indicate the
path of mining carts, which lie only in the center of the tunnel. The sides
seem to have been given to regular villagers. Miners walk in groups, while
a little lass with short whiskers can be seen carrying home some groceries.
Dwarven children, who have not yet begun education in any of the principle
areas of the town, play in the large tunnel, dodging through the mining
carts. The path south leads to a junction in the Main Way, while to the
north the Main Way continues.

Surprisingly, the tunnel east, while plenty big enough for the carts, has
no tracks leading in that direction. Villagers are plentiful in the area of
this junction, some chatting wildly with each other, while others sit on
the benches, which have been erected around the junction sign. Torches
bring an abundance of light to this underground tunnel.

    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below

[36mA Small Camp[0;37m
    This make shift camp seems to serve as a residence for a group of young
dwarven hunters from Deep Mine. Scattered pans and pots filled with old
stews intermingle with a variety of long spears. The mess is indicative of
the young dwarves's bachelorhood; no respectable dwarven woman would be
taking care of this group of swine and filth. A small fire burns in the
center of the camp.

holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a

unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,

    Dark gray walls climb to the ceiling of this massive stalagmite.
Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

    The walls in this portion of the stalagmite are very different from
those previously encountered. There are no smooth curves, bumps, or odd
colors. Coffee-colored walls surround this small cavern and capture the
moist air and smells that waft in from other areas of the stalagmite. This
bubble in the stalagmite appears to contain less moisture than the other
ones, but it still has collected several small puddles on the floor. Cloved
hoofprints can be found all over, none leading in any particular direction.
The stalagmite continues to the south.

definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the

    On both sides of a long dried path are huge puddles of a strangely
sweet-smelling mud. Thankfully, the path provides relief from the messy
mud-covered entrance of the stalagmite. Cloved prints pockmark the path,
too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room.
Stacked in a surprisingly organized pile to the north is a pile of
shattered armaboro hides. The path through the den leads to the east and
south. A terrifying odor seems to be wafting in from the east.

    On both sides of a long dried path are huge puddles of a strangely
sweet-smelling mud. Thankfully, the path provides relief from the messy
mud-covered entrance of the stalagmite. Cloved prints pockmark the path,
too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room.
Stacked in a surprisingly organized pile to the north is a pile of
shattered armaboro hides. The path through the den leads to the east and
south. A terrifying odor seems to be wafting in from the east.

    If the rest of the den is disgustingly muddy, this area encourages
vomit. A gigantic pile of armaboro excrement is heaped against the
northeast corner--a heavier shade of nasty than the mud. As well as the
stench is masked by the mud, the absolute reeking of shit is nearly
intolerable. In fact, if not for the mud's masking, it is likely that you'd
be passed out on the floor. Paths away from the mud lead to the south and
west.

    If the rest of the den is disgustingly muddy, this area encourages
vomit. A gigantic pile of armaboro excrement is heaped against the
northeast corner--a heavier shade of nasty than the mud. As well as the
stench is masked by the mud, the absolute reeking of shit is nearly
intolerable. In fact, if not for the mud's masking, it is likely that you'd
be passed out on the floor. Paths away from the mud lead to the south and
west.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A

vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
