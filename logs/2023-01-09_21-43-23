    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the

sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

     You are on the rough waters of Newsea. The weather is harsh and the
sky is gloomy. It is very tough to navigate through the turbulent waters,
large waves and strong winds seem to cover much of this sea. The waters
here seems unnaturally dark, and you see few signs of sea life.

    The yellowish sands seamlessly slope into the waters of Newsea as the
waters ebb and flow along the shoreline. The sounds of the sea rhythmically
wash alongst the shore, offering a consistent melody. The caw of sea birds
can be heard before they are seen, taking off and landing atop the waters
to the west. The sandy beach leads eastwards and comes to a trailhead,
leading through some verdant rolling hills. The sky is partially cloudy,
and a drizzle of rain can be felt from time to time.

Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name

known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.

    The cruel sun beats down on the road here, cracking the dried soil.
The land here suffers badly from the unrelenting winds that blow across the
desert to the west. Lizards take shelter in the shadows of the rocks where
the sand is not hot enough to roast them, but there is no shade large
enough for larger animals. Each step sinks into the searing sand, the air
thick and hazy, each breath like drowning in lava.

[36mCrossing the Thon-Thalas River[0;37m
    The beating sun bakes the dirt road in such heat that the road has
cracked into what almost resembles cobblestones. Insects scurry across,
careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only
option is to continue either north or south.

    The road begins to narrow to the north as it grows steadily steeper.
Far in the distance, the road winds as it carves a path through the
foothills of the Khalkists. Vegetation is less sparse further up the
path, offering more sights for the arduous climb. The view to the south is
a stark contrast, as the road widens and flattens. For miles the road
continues straight with very little to see except for an expansive yellow
sea of sand.

    This narrow road winds a treacherous path through these grim foothills.
The trail is rocky and somewhat unstable, through clumps of pine trees and
the occasional hardwood, though other than that the terrain is rather
monotonous. The land is hilly, though not altogether rugged, as most of the
hillsides that comprise the area are grassy or covered with small rocks.
The jagged, violent peaks of the Khalkist Mountains sneer at you high
above to the north.

    The narrow road twists and winds around the larger foothills here.
These hills are the southern extent of the mightly Khalkist Mountains which
loom over you to the north. The peaks are such a bleak, dark grey, they
almost look charred against the sky. To the south the rocky road flattens
somewhat into more hilly foothills while those to the north only become
more treacherous and rocky. In the distance you can see faint signs of
smoke barely rising above the foothills far to the southwest.

     The sea opens wide before you as make your exit from the comparatively
calm water of Balifor Bay. Seagulls fly overhead gently fluttering against
the strong sea breezes; time is of no concern to these creatures. Catching
sight of a fish, a gull swoops down spearing dinner in a quick jab before
returning to the skies above.

    Sparkling in the light, a series of small islands girds the southern
coast of the Dairly Plains. The beauty of the uninhabited lands is so great
that any who have seen is claim to have seen the very adornments of
Habbakuk. The rush of the waters in the distance battles against the sound
of the soft grasses swaying like the legendary dancers of Sorinthalas.
Pastures reach like a helping hand across the Southern Dairly Plains,
inhabited by winsome antelope and feral boars. Tiny animals scurry among
the high grasses, heard but never seen save for the faint motion of the
grass against the gentle winds.

[36mThe Outskirts of Khotta[0;37m
    The village of Khotta is the southernmost encampment along the Dairly
Plains. The bustle of the small village can be heard over the rustling of
the grass and the distant crashing of waves. Far in the distance the
cooking fires from a native village can be seen, a thin haze of grey in the
otherwise clear skies. There is not a tree to be seen along the horizon:
this part of the Dairly Plains is a single, unbroken field of waist-tall
greenery. The path becomes broader in this part of the grasslands, with
occasional holes and ruts carved by carts carrying goods.

[36mThe Southern Dairly Plains[0;37m
    Pastures reach like a helping hand across the Southern Dairly Plains,
inhabited by winsome antelope and feral boars. Tall grasses, higher than a
kender's head, wave in the soft breezes which caress the fragrant Dairly
Plains. The meadows are populated by wildflowers and a wide variety of
grains: rye and barley move gracefully among the sheafs of wheat. Thick,
rich loam, as black as a starless night, provides sustenance for the
grasslands, fields of clover reaching towards the balmy edge of the sea.

[36mNearing the Maddening Springs[0;37m
    The Southern Dairly Plainsmen tell tales of the healing powers of the
Maddening Springs. The legends claim the stream of boiling-hot water which
spouts from the ground here is capable of healing even the most horrendous
of injuries, but at a cost. The heat of the geyser is so great that many
are driven mad in their quest for panacea. Steam can be seen rising into
the air as the Springs begin another eruption. The meadows are populated by
wildflowers and a wide variety of grains: rye and barley move gracefully
among the sheafs of wheat.

Peninsula, larger than even Ran-Khal, with stone buildings and paved
streets. The sweet perfume of tall grains is carried by the winds, mixing

ocean of viridescent life, the wind roils the tall weeds. It is as if the
fields are massive emerald waves. Tall grasses, higher than a kender's

slender path winds along the relatively flat ground, well-marked and easy
to follow, used by generations of inhabitants.

across the Southern Dairly Plains, inhabited by winsome antelope and feral
boars. The meadows are populated by wildflowers and a wide variety of
grains: rye and barley move gracefully among the sheafs of wheat. A slender
path winds along the relatively flat ground, well-marked and easy to
follow, used by generations of inhabitants.

    Tall grasses, higher than a kender's head, wave in the soft breezes
which caress the fragrant Dairly Plains. Pastures reach like a helping hand
across the Southern Dairly Plains, inhabited by winsome antelope and feral
boars. The meadows are populated by wildflowers and a wide variety of
grains: rye and barley move gracefully among the sheafs of wheat. A slender
path winds along the relatively flat ground, well-marked and easy to
follow, used by generations of inhabitants.

    Notorious for its violent tides and monumental changes in depth, the
Maw creates an intraversible border between the sligs of the Laughing Lands
and the Dairly Plainsmen. A narrow inlet allow access to the perilous
waters here, littered with broken boats from sailors who dared to attempt a
crossing. A few hulls of larger ships can be seen in the reefs of jagged
coral a few hundred feet off of shore. The access, while indubitably
dangerous, could potentially be navigated by skilled and stalwart sailors
who feel no fear for the wrath of Morgion, the black wind.

    The Maw runs north-south between the Dairly Plains and the Laughing
Lands, a broad sea keeping the two factions separated. Thick, rich loam, as
black as a starless night, provides sustenance for the grasslands, fields
of clover reaching towards the balmy edge of the sea. The rush of the
waters in the distance battles against the sound of the soft grasses
swaying like the legendary dancers of Sorinthalas. Tiny animals scurry
among the high grasses, heard but never seen save for the faint motion of
the grass against the gentle winds.

wind roils the tall weeds: the effect is like massive emerald waves. Tall
grasses, higher than a kender's head, wave in the soft breezes which caress
the fragrant Dairly Plains. The meadows are popualted by wildflowers and a
wide variety of grains: rye and barley move gracefully among the sheafs of
wheat. Thick, rich loam, as black as a starless night, provides sustenance

[36mThe Plainsmen's Burial Grounds[0;37m
    A slender path winds along the relatively flat ground, well-marked and
easy to follow, used by generations of inhabitants. This is where the
plainsmen from the north and south come to bury their dead and pay respects
to the ancestors. The green grass in this part of the Dairly Plains seems
less vivid and vivacious. The soil has turned an ashy grey, and a faint
howl, like that of an unrequited spirit, wanders aimlessly across the
savannah.

[36mThe Haunting Sadness[0;37m
    Lying along the borders between the Northern and Southern Dairly
Plains, this massive burial mound is a shared place of reverence for all
the eastern plainsmen. Tribes from north and south make the journey to this
hallowed hill to lay the dead to rest in the tombs of their ancestors. The
feeling of sorrow is almost tangible, and the reverence which the plainsmen
hold for this place manifests as a palpable sense of piety. This is a place
where the dead hold sway, more powerful than the discordant opposition of
mortal affairs.

    Tiny cracks and crevices run throughout this ancient cairn, carved out
of the rich loam of the Dairly Plains over one thousand years ago. The
totems of the various tribes are scattered throughout the mound, placed
carefully in niches and gaps within each wall, without any particular area
belonging to any single tribe. In the hollows of the ghostly monument there
are no tribes, only the unified spirits of generations of natives: any of
the holes and fissures placed irregularly through the winding passages may
hold the effects of four or five different tribes. Many of the glyphs in
each cleft or breach reveal the totems of tribes which have been otherwise
lost to the ravages of time. The earthen partitions, laden with nooks and
crannies, meander aimlessly through the sepulcher, touring the proud
history of the Dairly Plains and the people who call it home.

[36mWithin the Burial Mound of the Dairly Plainsmen[0;37m
    Tiny cracks and crevices run throughout this ancient cairn, carved out
of the rich loam of the Dairly Plains over one thousand years ago. The
totems of the various tribes are scattered throughout the mound, placed
carefully in niches and gaps within each wall, without any particular area
belonging to any single tribe. In the hollows of the ghostly monument there
are no tribes, only the unified spirits of generations of natives: any of
the holes and fissures placed irregularly through the winding passages may
hold the effects of four or five different tribes. Many of the glyphs in
each cleft or breach reveal the totems of tribes which have been otherwise
lost to the ravages of time. The earthen partitions, laden with nooks and
crannies, meander aimlessly through the sepulcher, touring the proud
history of the Dairly Plains and the people who call it home.

    Tiny cracks and crevices run throughout this ancient cairn, carved out
of the rich loam of the Dairly Plains over one thousand years ago. The
totems of the various tribes are scattered throughout the mound, placed
carefully in niches and gaps within each wall, without any particular area
belonging to any single tribe. In the hollows of the ghostly monument there
are no tribes, only the unified spirits of generations of natives: any of
the holes and fissures placed irregularly through the winding passages may
hold the effects of four or five different tribes. Many of the glyphs in
each cleft or breach reveal the totems of tribes which have been otherwise

    Tiny cracks and crevices run throughout this ancient cairn, carved out
of the rich loam of the Dairly Plains over one thousand years ago. The
totems of the various tribes are scattered throughout the mound, placed
carefully in niches and gaps within each wall, without any particular area
belonging to any single tribe. In the hollows of the ghostly monument there
are no tribes, only the unified spirits of generations of natives: any of
the holes and fissures placed irregularly through the winding passages may
hold the effects of four or five different tribes. Many of the glyphs in
each cleft or breach reveal the totems of tribes which have been otherwise
lost to the ravages of time. The earthen partitions, laden with nooks and
crannies, meander aimlessly through the sepulcher, touring the proud
history of the Dairly Plains and the people who call it home.

[36mWithin the Burial Mound of the Dairly Plainsmen[0;37m
    Tiny cracks and crevices run throughout this ancient cairn, carved out
of the rich loam of the Dairly Plains over one thousand years ago. The
totems of the various tribes are scattered throughout the mound, placed
carefully in niches and gaps within each wall, without any particular area
belonging to any single tribe. In the hollows of the ghostly monument there
are no tribes, only the unified spirits of generations of natives: any of
the holes and fissures placed irregularly through the winding passages may
hold the effects of four or five different tribes. Many of the glyphs in
each cleft or breach reveal the totems of tribes which have been otherwise
lost to the ravages of time. The earthen partitions, laden with nooks and
crannies, meander aimlessly through the sepulcher, touring the proud
history of the Dairly Plains and the people who call it home.

A living man who has spent his life among the dead, this tall shaman towers
amongst the earthen ramparts of the mound. His vision is poor, his life
spent staring beyond the realm of the living into the realm of the dead.
However, his thin limbs, gaunt from near starvation, still hold enough
strength to fight anyone who would dare to impose against the will of the
ancient spirits. He is given a strength beyond his meager size: his
strength comes from the spirits of those who have come before him.

A living man who has spent his life among the dead, this tall shaman towers
amongst the earthen ramparts of the mound. His vision is poor, his life
spent staring beyond the realm of the living into the realm of the dead.
However, his thin limbs, gaunt from near starvation, still hold enough
strength to fight anyone who would dare to impose against the will of the
ancient spirits. He is given a strength beyond his meager size: his
strength comes from the spirits of those who have come before him.
Skyseeker, the Grand Shaman has some small wounds and bruises.

[36mWithin the Burial Mound of the Dairly Plainsmen[0;37m
    Tiny cracks and crevices run throughout this ancient cairn, carved out
of the rich loam of the Dairly Plains over one thousand years ago. The
totems of the various tribes are scattered throughout the mound, placed
carefully in niches and gaps within each wall, without any particular area
belonging to any single tribe. In the hollows of the ghostly monument there
are no tribes, only the unified spirits of generations of natives: any of
the holes and fissures placed irregularly through the winding passages may
hold the effects of four or five different tribes. Many of the glyphs in
each cleft or breach reveal the totems of tribes which have been otherwise
lost to the ravages of time. The earthen partitions, laden with nooks and
crannies, meander aimlessly through the sepulcher, touring the proud
history of the Dairly Plains and the people who call it home.

    Tiny cracks and crevices run throughout this ancient cairn, carved out
of the rich loam of the Dairly Plains over one thousand years ago. The
totems of the various tribes are scattered throughout the mound, placed
carefully in niches and gaps within each wall, without any particular area
belonging to any single tribe. In the hollows of the ghostly monument there
are no tribes, only the unified spirits of generations of natives: any of
the holes and fissures placed irregularly through the winding passages may
hold the effects of four or five different tribes. Many of the glyphs in
each cleft or breach reveal the totems of tribes which have been otherwise
lost to the ravages of time. The earthen partitions, laden with nooks and
crannies, meander aimlessly through the sepulcher, touring the proud
history of the Dairly Plains and the people who call it home.

[36mWithin the Burial Mound of the Dairly Plainsmen[0;37m
    Tiny cracks and crevices run throughout this ancient cairn, carved out
of the rich loam of the Dairly Plains over one thousand years ago. The
totems of the various tribes are scattered throughout the mound, placed
carefully in niches and gaps within each wall, without any particular area
belonging to any single tribe. In the hollows of the ghostly monument there
are no tribes, only the unified spirits of generations of natives: any of
the holes and fissures placed irregularly through the winding passages may
hold the effects of four or five different tribes. Many of the glyphs in
each cleft or breach reveal the totems of tribes which have been otherwise
lost to the ravages of time. The earthen partitions, laden with nooks and
crannies, meander aimlessly through the sepulcher, touring the proud
history of the Dairly Plains and the people who call it home.

[35mThe Halls of Myth[0;37m
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    The sandy beach is very warm and friendly. A few seagulls are flying
above your head trying to catch some fish in the clear water. In the far
north you can see a tremendous mountain reaching into the sky. The shore
continues to the north and south and a small path leads to the west through
the forest. To the east you can see the pier.

     Although the jungle you have seen so far has been the stuff of dark
nightmares, there's something about your surroundings here that is sending
shivers up and down your spine. The jungle's foliage is considerably

[36mTop of a Rise[0;37m
     As you reach the crest of this hill, your breath is swept away by the
vision before you. Out of a cloud of steam hugging the ground, a massive
volcano stretches into the heavens themselves. Flaring oranges and dirty
yellows clash along the brown rocks as lava flows wend their slow way down
the cliffside, and you notice a rough, overgrown path snakes through the
jungle from here into the fog below.

     Gods, the heat! You stand at the base of the volcano: before you, a
huge pool of molten lava boils, and as bubbles on the surface burst black
smoke belches towards the skies. The ground at your feet is hard and
blackened, and the foliage here has all been burnt to a crisp. As far as
you can see upwards through the smoke, lava pours down the mountainside in
a continuous firefall, and you are forced to dodge as the dangerous liquid
splashes into the pool.

hands of no mortal could have crafted the temple before you. Surrounded by
overgrown gardens, a massive set of marble stairs directly in front of you
extends upward into an entrance carved into the sheer side of the volcano.
Rather than end in a dark cavern opening, however, the entire side of the
mountain has been carved to represent a massive temple, with towering stone
columns extending some one hundred feet high, and ending in an intricately
carved pediment.

     Now that you can see inside the barbican's walls, you realize that the
hands of no mortal could have crafted the temple before you. Surrounded by
overgrown gardens, a massive set of marble stairs directly in front of you
extends upward into an entrance carved into the sheer side of the volcano.
Rather than end in a dark cavern opening, however, the entire side of the
mountain has been carved to represent a massive temple, with towering stone
columns extending some one hundred feet high, and ending in an intricately
carved pediment.

[36mThe Gatehouse[0;37m
     Sitting directly over both sides of the massive wooden doors of the
keep, the occupants of this room are in charge of the gate defense. Two
massive portcullis and cranks sit poised to drop on either side of the keep
gates below, and judging from the evenly-spaced indents in the crimson rug
covering the room's floor, if you moved the rug you would see murder holes
cut into the stone for archers. A small bed and desk lie in the corner.

extends upward into an entrance carved into the sheer side of the volcano.
Rather than end in a dark cavern opening, however, the entire side of the
mountain has been carved to represent a massive temple, with towering stone
columns extending some one hundred feet high, and ending in an intricately
carved pediment.

open top of the tower, you are visited with feelings of

Nevermind to the east you can see Northern and Southern Ergoth, and far
past that the lights of the docks of Palanthas wink at you from across the
Sirrion Sea. From the strips of cloth at your feet you see that once the
flag of the Knights of Solamnia flew here, but now, snapping overhead, a
gruesome banner has been raised in it's place.

Rather than end in a dark cavern opening, however, the entire side of the
mountain has been carved to represent a massive temple, with towering stone
columns extending some one hundred feet high, and ending in an intricately
carved pediment.

[36mInside the Solamnic Ruins[0;37m
     Before you stretches a vision from darkest nightmare. The quiet stone
hallway leading deeper into the volcano was obviously once the entrance to
a majestic temple devoted to the patron gods of the Solamnic Orders, but
there is something very wrong here. Crimson splashes of blood coat the
walls and floor, filling the air with a sickening smell. The once-beautiful

in blood, and deep gouges and scratches have been made in the stonework

inhuman shriek coming from the north, followed by maniacal laughter.

You stand at the back, behind rows of pews, and gaze upwards where
delicately carven stone arches criss-cross the ceiling. Stone statues of
the Solamnic patron gods line the walls, but several have been smashed and
broken, and ribbons of crimson stains now color the cold grey walls. Large
stone sconces line the walls beneath the main arches, casting shadows among
the wooden pews.

oak door stands just slightly ajar, the yellow glow of lamplight seeping
into the corridor from the crack. The corridor leads south back towards a

     A massive room stretches out before you, filled with countless rows of
neatly arranged cots. Biers and wall torches cast flickering shadows across
the spotless floor, adding to the somber mood of the room. You notice on

along with massive kite shields emblazoned with the Grimguard Legion
insignia.

oak door stands just slightly ajar, the yellow glow of lamplight seeping
into the corridor from the crack. The corridor leads south back towards a

You stand at the back, behind rows of pews, and gaze upwards where
delicately carven stone arches criss-cross the ceiling. Stone statues of
the Solamnic patron gods line the walls, but several have been smashed and
broken, and ribbons of crimson stains now color the cold grey walls. Large
stone sconces line the walls beneath the main arches, casting shadows among
the wooden pews.

     Once the living quarters of the temple's priests, this large room has
now been taken over by a a group of mages. Shelves have been cleared of
religious icons, now dumped uncerimoniously in the corner, and replaced
with books and odd-shaped bottles. In the center of the room the floor has
been cleared for a summoning circle, and twelve blood red candles light
equidistant points with an eerie glow.

[36mEntrance to the Chapel[0;37m
     Stretching out before you is a massive temple with an arched ceiling.
You stand at the back, behind rows of pews, and gaze upwards where
delicately carven stone arches criss-cross the ceiling. Stone statues of
the Solamnic patron gods line the walls, but several have been smashed and
broken, and ribbons of crimson stains now color the cold grey walls. Large
stone sconces line the walls beneath the main arches, casting shadows among
the wooden pews.

     This corridor leads west behind the chapel towards the former barracks
and offices of the Solamnic Legion stationed here. Racks of swords and pole
arms line the walls on either side, and torches sputter and cast eerie
shadows down the stone corridor. Somewhere ahead the harsh laughter of men
at arms rings out amongst the clash and clang of steel on steel.

[36mApproaching an Intersection[0;37m
     The flickering and hissing of the torches from the wall sconces shows
that directly to the west lies an intersection in the corridor. On the
walls, large decorative shields of the Grimguard Legion have been strung
over the tattered remains of once-glorious tapestries, and the five-headed
dragons on the insignias give you a sense of deep forboding.

     Deep within the barracks section of the temple the corridor comes to
an abrupt stop. To the east, the doorless room of a massive barracks
stretches farther than torchlight can penetrate, and to the north a solid
oak door stands just slightly ajar, the yellow glow of lamplight seeping
into the corridor from the crack. The corridor leads south back towards a
large intersection.

     Spartan yet efficient-looking, the Lord Commander of the Grimguard
Legion has taken over the Solamnic Knight's conference chamber for an
office. Maps of Sancrist and the Ergoths are spread over the large stone
table, and weapons and suits of armor line the walls in racks. A small desk
and cot have been placed in the room's northwest corner. As you survey the
room, you notice with revulsion a grim reminder of the former residents of
this temple on the east wall of the room.

over the tattered remains of once-glorious tapestries, and the five-headed
dragons on the insignias give you a sense of deep forboding.

at arms rings out amongst the clash and clang of steel on steel.

     Stretching out before you is a massive temple with an arched ceiling.
You stand at the back, behind rows of pews, and gaze upwards where
delicately carven stone arches criss-cross the ceiling. Stone statues of
the Solamnic patron gods line the walls, but several have been smashed and
broken, and ribbons of crimson stains now color the cold grey walls. Large
stone sconces line the walls beneath the main arches, casting shadows among
the wooden pews.

once-holy place is occasionally marred by a sharp scream bouncing off of
the stone around you.

you momentarily as you survey the chapel around you. Wooden rows of pews
lie to the west and east, and the rubble-strewn aisle leads south to the

you notice that you stand on one side of a massive dome, its lofty perch
too high apparently to have been included in the desecration of this

[36mThe Desecrated Altar[0;37m
     Apparently once a beautiful carved marble altar, this holy relic
created by the gods themselves has been horrifyingly desecrated. The blood
of countless sacrifices drys in blotches all over it's surface, and arcane
symbols have been formed in the sickening crimson pools. A massive tapestry
on the wall behind the altar once depicted a massive circle enclosing the
symbol of Paladine overlaid with a sword, crown and rose, but now hangs in
blood-stained tatters.

tones in every dingy tavern from Palanthas to Flotsam. Not satisfied with
the peaceful life of a cleric of Paladine, he left the fold after exacting
a small amount of revenge for the way he was treated as a novice
(eventually they were able to scrape most of the high priest of that temple
off the ceiling). Devoted to himself, Takhisis and the Legion in that
order, his coarse good looks and ample strength hide immense power granted
by the Dark Queen herself.
Ombra has some small wounds and bruises.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.

sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

[35mThe Forge of Myth[0;37m
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

[35mThe Forge of Myth[0;37m
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

[35mThe Alchemy Lab of Myth[0;37m
    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.
[33m[1mA thin key made of the finest silver lies in the dust.

    You stand in a high-domed room with a black marble floor. At its center,
stairs lead up to a circular pedestal with a massive portal framed by shiny
bronze beams. The surface of the portal swirls slowly in a hypnotic pattern,
inviting you to touch it.

[35mThe Halls of Myth[0;37m
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
