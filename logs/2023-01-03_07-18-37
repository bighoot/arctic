    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

can be heard before they are seen, taking off and landing atop the waters
to the west. The sandy beach leads eastwards and comes to a trailhead,
leading through some verdant rolling hills. The sky is partially cloudy,
and a drizzle of rain can be felt from time to time.

the terrain opens up into a vast desert known as the Plains of Dust. There
is almost a distinguishable line where the sands from the plains meets the

Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name

known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.

    The trail continues to the east and west, along the edge of the Forest
of Silvanesti. Tall timbers line the sides of the path that creates a
quaint corridor effect. The trees seem to thin out here, giving way to a
more verdant landscape of various shrubbery. Animals trails intersect the
main path leading through the area. Mountain ranges are barely visible to
the north and to the east the terrain seems more rigid and bare. Traveling
here seems peaceful and unencumbered.

    Several climates converge on the groves of trees loosely dotting the
grassy landscape here, and signs of wildlife can be seen all throughout
the area. The lush forests to the south evoke a sense of peacefulness.
Mountains line the horizon to the north and rolling deserts far to the
east, while thick tree cover to the south denotes the legendary forests of
Silvanesti. An unkempt trail lingers from moderate traffic to the east and
west.

    The cruel sun beats down on the road here, cracking the dried soil.
The land here suffers badly from the unrelenting winds that blow across the
desert to the west. Lizards take shelter in the shadows of the rocks where
the sand is not hot enough to roast them, but there is no shade large
enough for larger animals. Each step sinks into the searing sand, the air
thick and hazy, each breath like drowning in lava.

    The beating sun bakes the dirt road in such heat that the road has
cracked into what almost resembles cobblestones. Insects scurry across,
careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only
option is to continue either north or south.

    The road begins to narrow to the north as it grows steadily steeper.
Far in the distance, the road winds as it carves a path through the
foothills of the Khalkists. Vegetation is less sparse further up the
path, offering more sights for the arduous climb. The view to the south is
a stark contrast, as the road widens and flattens. For miles the road
continues straight with very little to see except for an expansive yellow
sea of sand.

The trail is rocky and somewhat unstable, through clumps of pine trees and
the occasional hardwood, though other than that the terrain is rather
monotonous. The land is hilly, though not altogether rugged, as most of the
hillsides that comprise the area are grassy or covered with small rocks.

These hills are the southern extent of the mightly Khalkist Mountains which
loom over you to the north. The peaks are such a bleak, dark grey, they
almost look charred against the sky. To the south the rocky road flattens

more treacherous and rocky. In the distance you can see faint signs of

    The lands of Ak-Tubal and Kalin Ak-Phan stretch out to the east. They
are flat, dry, grassy plains infamous for their unbearable heat during the
summer solstice. Although the conditions can be harsh, you can see several
clumps of hardwoods providing some shade for travellers. Far east beyond
the huge plains you can barely make out the glittering waves of the Khurman
Sea. The altitude descends north of there, though to the south you can see
the jagged, towering peaks of the mighty Khalkist Mountains.

near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the

    The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

[36mThe Tollhouse[0;37m
    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    There is a fair-size clearing here, but as you look north and west, you
see the passageways are much tighter. To the north, there is a passage
between the walls of the mountain and a bunch of boulders and rubble piled
high. Westward, a small path winds its way into the depths of the Kharolis
Mountains, passing between a mountainside and jagged cliffs. To the south,
a steep, but usable path leads down to the road near Tarsis.

    This small passageway winds its way between the boulders at the foot
of the mountain to the north and the sheer face of a cliff looming above
you to the south. The passage is small, but looks fairly easy traveled for
quite a ways. Both to the east and the west, the passage continues.

    Cleverly hidden from prying eyes, this narrow path winds its way
amongst massive boulders of basalt and granite. The shrubs separating this
path from the one to the south are mounted on a hinge, making it easy to
slip out undetected. The path ascends slowly as it bends to the west.

    The giant rock looming over the path is as tall as a vallenwood, and it
must be the biggest boulder on the entire continent. Although its surface
has been methodically eroded by weather, mere nature has done nothing to
diminish its massive size. A narrow path leads off to the east, while the
foot of an impossibly tall mountain lies a few steps to the north.

    The ground here at the foot of the mountain is unnaturally smooth,
almost as if the rock was hewn flat to ease the passage of trade carts. Of
course, there are no cart marks and few bootprints, so perhaps it's just
nature playing tricks on the mind. The unusually flat ground continues and
expands to the west, while a narrow gap between the giant boulders off to
the south allows relatively easy movement in that direction.

there are no cart marks and few bootprints, even if the smooth area seems
unnaturally wide and the cliff formed by the mountain meeting the ground is
perfectly vertical. The unusually flat ground narrows a bit as it continues

    A row of heavy fortifications are arranged facing the southern wall,
designed to protect dwarven warriors in case invaders are somehow able to
break through the giant stone plug known as Southgate. Any invading forces
resilient enough to make it past the first line of defenses will be forced
to suddenly turn right, which makes fighting very awkward for right-handed
fighters, to ascend the huge spiral ramp that leads into Thorbardin.

small side street to the east which leads to a residential area.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a dwarf steps off on
this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must
have fallen off contraptions being transported to other parts of the huge
mountain kingdom. Unlike gnomish parts, these spare parts are as finely
made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

    This large square has been carefully carved out of the limestone, and
it was once a beautiful testament to dwarven stonework. Now, however, the
scratched stone floor is littered with loose gears, broken tools, random
screws and half-finished contraptions. The famed Hylar engineers must work
in the nearby buildings, perfecting the technology that the dwarves use to
defend their mountain home and keep their mighty kingdom running.

made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of

given the race's reputation for drinking and the infamy of their signature

get dingy, but is otherwise a serviceable place to get a stiff drink.

    The most remarkable thing about this homey square is its incredible
unremarkableness. It is just another place where a bunch of dwarven homes
are gathered, creating a safe place for children to play. The home to the
west has been shuttered up, but those to the north and south are clearly
lived in. The great lifts lie back to the east from here.

[36mLevel 12 Lift Station[0;37m
    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and almost every single one stops on
this level to drop off a few gruff dwarven commoners. The area is fairly
clean except for some small piles of refuse, as if the garbage collectors
don't come by frequently enough. All of the massive stone archways leading
away from the lift station are plain and unadorned, but the archway to the
south appears to have been recently and permanently boarded up.

    In stark contrast to the excessive opulence of the rest of the home,
this bedroom is both plain and incomplete. The walls are half-painted with
golden veneer, the dresser and chairs are made from cheap pine wood and
the floor is covered with a bedroll instead of a rug. The only furniture
that remotely exudes wealth is the golden four-post bed, but three of the
posts are unfinished. It's as if the owner of the home ran out of money.

    While this enormous grand hall is only slightly less gilded than the
antechamber before it, it is still more opulently decorated than most royal
palaces elsewhere in the world. The owner's taste for platinum and gold is
again on display, this time tempered with mahogany accents that make the
room less blinding to stand in. Besides the antechamber to the west, the
only other exit is a small platinum door on the north side of the hall. It

are lined with platinum and gold panels, suggesting that the dwarves who
live here must be among the wealthiest in Thorbardin. Elaborate carvings
adorn the impressive doors set in the magnificent archways to the east and

of the four archways is carved in the style and stone of a different clan,
named by the plaques above them: Theiwar, Daewar, Daergar and Klar.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and the dwarves who disembark on this

are adorned with majestic sculptures that tell the stories how all of the
dwarven clans came together to found the mighty nation of Thorbardin. Each
of the four archways is carved in the style and stone of a different clan,
named by the plaques above them: Theiwar, Daewar, Daergar and Klar.

tapers until it is only as wide around as a dwarven waist where it merges
with the limestone island beneath it. A trio of vertical transport shafts
cut through the center of the Life Tree, and the screeching pulleys of the
steam-powered lifts drown out the sounds coming from the nearby docks.

diamonds embedded in the domed black ceiling to resemble stars, arranged
like the constellations of Paladine and Takhisis circling each other. The
bridges lead off in each of the cardinal directions, but since the southern
part of the hall has caved in, the end of that bridge has been blocked.

Of course, there are no cart marks and few bootprints, so perhaps it's just

    The mountain seems to open its mouth and swallow you as you walk into its
open maw. The opening is large and dwarves are milling about waiting for
their turn to work in the mine. The dust is suspended in the air as the dry
mine air escapes out the shaft. The tunnel leads west into the mine and east
into the mountain air.

but forcing taller travellers to hunch down. From the west you can hear the
distant sounds of orders being shouted out, echoing off the walls, while from
the east the sounds of metal working can faintly be heard. A small torch
hangs from a wall and flickers in the soft dusty breeze. The sounds of merry
activity can be heard from the south and echos of hammering and shouting can
be heard emitting from the hole in the ground.

getting debris rained down on them. You can either ascend to the surface or

    The wide tunnels here lead north and south, while a ladder leads up into
a narrow shaft. It is well lit here, torches line the walls, lit with magical
flames that never flicker or fade. While the tunnel leading south is draped
in darkness and shadow, the tunnel leading north appears to be heavily
travelled. The sound of picks striking stone can be heard from the north,
nearly being drowned out by the sounds of shouting echoing off the walls.

[36mA Slippery Bank[0;37m
    The shoreline here is featureless, the lack of waves and shoreline
activity explains the absence of a beach. Instead, a thin deposit of dead and
living molds show the various and current lake levels. The bank rises sharply
up onto a rock plateau. You can follow the shoreline, climb the bank, or
enter the lake from here.

here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the

in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A

    The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace dominates
one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill the
room. A stairway leads up, further into the tree, while another stairway
leads down to the forest below.

    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the

     Branching off from the main road that runs through southern Solamnia,
this small trail slowly ascends upwards as its plunges into the snowy and
rugged Garnet Mountains.  The mountains are said to be the home of the
dwarven nation of Garnet, enemies of the highlord and Lemish.  The
vegetation thins out as you travel away from the plains and into the
mountains.  Occasionally, you spot a few mountain animals here and there.
You hope that these shy creatures are the only ones inhabiting the
snow-topped peaks.

greeted with immense waves of heat.  In the center of the room, there is a
large black furnace.  Around the room, there are several racks of forged
weapons waiting to be picked up by the dwarven soldiers.  Though Garnet is
a peaceful nation, it has mobilized for war against the kingdom of Lemish
and the dragon armies. The smith here must work endlessly to put out the
weapons and armor needed to mount such an offensive.  There is no exit,
save for the one you came in.  You are very hot and want to leave.

    Winding its way through the windy and fertile Plains, the highway
stretches to the east and to the west, escaping the horizon. Quiet and
depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the highway, their
heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the
highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and weeds.
The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire. To the

    The resplendent western gate is more for show than effective.
Buttressed against the side of a mountain range, the city is shielded from
an incoming ground invasion from this direction. Because of this, the gate
has rarely been opened, forcing visitors to travel to the northern gate to
be permitted entrance.

    This street intersects in all four directions. To the south, you can
hear peddlers shouting their wares for sale, as the street opens up into a
marketplace. To the north lies a massive gate, the entrance and exit into
Lytburg for travellers visiting the city. Noble homes line both sides of
the street in the eastern direction, while to the west live those who are
less fortunate.

are actually part of the same town. The grit of battle and preparation have

is the first indication that all is not well in the town of Lytburg.

    The cobbled road comes to an abrupt halt before the gates of the town's
keep. In peacetime, the gates would normally stand open, but as the town is
besieged, they stand barred and guarded against all but official business
pertinant to the war effort. All traffic has given a wide berth to the
keep, keeping out of the way of patrols which are sent hourly to safeguard
the city.

scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of

[36mThe West Bank[0;37m
    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

[36mThe West Bank[0;37m
    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

    The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal
place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,
scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

[36mA Road Through the Plains[0;37m
    A narrow road runs from the north to the south here, paralleling the
Eastwall mountains that rise from the plains a short ways to the east. The
plains also extend to the west where they run into an arm of the Kharolis
mountains. Judging from the height of the grass, you can only assume that
the land sandwiched between these two ranges must be very fertile.

[36mNear the Shore of Newsea[0;37m
    Waves from the Newsea crash onto the shoreline, sending spray of salty
water into the air. Strong gusts from the north whip at your clothes and
kick sand and water droplets into your face. From the eastern horizon to
the western horizon, all that can be seen are the waters of the Newsea.
Directly across the waters to the north you can barely make out a land mass
and a city, it must be Port o'Call. The sand along the shore becomes more
sparse to the south and a road leads away from the shoreline.

    The yellowish sands seamlessly slope into the waters of Newsea as the
waters ebb and flow along the shoreline. The sounds of the sea rhythmically
wash alongst the shore, offering a consistent melody. The caw of sea birds
can be heard before they are seen, taking off and landing atop the waters
to the west. The sandy beach leads eastwards and comes to a trailhead,
leading through some verdant rolling hills. The sky is partially cloudy,
and a drizzle of rain can be felt from time to time.

    The trail descends rapidly, the end of which can be seen leading to a
sandy shoreline. The waters of Newsea can be seen rushing onto the shore,
staining the sand with moisture. Far to the southeast, beyond the hills,
the terrain opens up into a vast desert known as the Plains of Dust. There
is almost a distinguishable line where the sands from the plains meets the
grass at the edge of the hills. The sun warms the hills, but some light
gray rain clouds can be seen moving in from the west.

[36mA Trail through the Hills[0;37m
    The trail cuts through the rolling hills and slopes gently downwards to
the west. There are very few trees present, but there is an abundance of
green grass. Far to the south, beyond the hills, the terrain opens up into
a vast desert known as the Plains of Dust. There is almost a
distinguishable line where the sands from the plains meets the grass at the
edge of the hills. The sun warms the hills, and provides nourishment for
the vegetation.

the winds flow through. Verdant foothills gently rise and fall all around,
but a clearly marked trail cuts through them at the lowest point. Fresh
wagon tracks form a depression in the trail and can be traced to the east
and north. A lightly traveled trail runs further west.

    A shady grove offers a cool place to rest at this intersection. The
rolling grasslands to the south extend beyond sight, running parallel to
the forest of Silvanesti. The southern tip of the Khalkist mountains lies a
great distance towards the west, and rise up like towering giants. Beyond
that, though not visible, lies the waters of New Sea. Ogre Peaks and Onyx
Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name
suggests, is home to many ogres. The land to the north is a mighty plain
known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.
Skirting the northern tip of the Silvanesti forest, the road continues east
into the lands of Khur.

careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent

distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only
option is to continue either north or south.

    A flat, wavy sea of grass expands around you. Wildflowers break the
verdant monotony of the vegetation underfoot occasionally, and several wild
fruit trees and roses also dot this path of mulch. A cool breeze blows in
from the northeast. The Khurman Sea, also known as the Bay of Balifor, is
not far from here. In the distance to the southwest, beyond several
foothills, you can barely make out the towering peaks of the Khalkhist
Mountains.

    This rough road winds its way through foothills near the Khalkist
Mountains which lay to the west. Lush, flat plains extend to the east and
northeast. These hills are green, dotted by the occasional dark grey
boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or
civilization can be seen in sight, as there are few footprints and no wagon
ruts on this rugged road.

[36mThe Main Lift[0;37m
    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of
the mountain above. Complicated gears and pulleys seem to work together in
an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

[36mThe Entrance to Deep Mine[0;37m
    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

[36mJunction Two[0;37m
    'Two' is written on a large sign on the eastern wall of the tunnel
here. The tunnel splits to the north, south, and west. It is lit by bright
torches above the sign. Many of the villagers walk about here. A group of
merchants mills around, having recently arrived from the main elevator
shaft, which lies directly to the west. To the north and south the Main Way
continues. The Deep Mine Main Shaft is the clear way back to the mountain
surface.

[36mJunction One[0;37m
    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

[36mBefore a Humble Inn[0;37m
    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

    Dark gray walls climb to the ceiling of this massive stalagmite.
Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

    You are at the edge of a large lake, stretching far to the north. Close
by to your west the sound of rushing water can be heard, where the lake
empties into the Solace Stream. Far to the west, large boulders jut up from
the rocky cliffs that rise along the shore. The trail follows the riverbank
south and leads around the eastern margin of the lake.

ascend the rapids into Crystalmir Lake. The road leads west into the
Sentinal Peaks and east along a narrow path to Solace.

in their place, limestone occurs. This must have frustrated the ancient
miners to no end, and you can imagine why this stope was abandoned. The
stope leads to a chamber to the west and the dark mine is east.

[36mA Small Tunnel[0;37m
    The narrow walls force you to inch your way along sideways. The roof is
still at least 10 feet high here but cross timbers hang low enough to
ensure that you duck your head several times. The stope seems to open up to
a large chamber to the west and leads out to a large tunnel to the south.

[36mThe Fault[0;37m
    The rock type seems to change instantly here. A large fault runs
vertically up both sides of the tunnel. The rich ore veins end suddenly and
in their place, limestone occurs. This must have frustrated the ancient
miners to no end, and you can imagine why this stope was abandoned. The
stope leads to a chamber to the west and the dark mine is east.

[36mThe Fault[0;37m
    The rock type seems to change instantly here. A large fault runs
vertically up both sides of the tunnel. The rich ore veins end suddenly and
in their place, limestone occurs. This must have frustrated the ancient
miners to no end, and you can imagine why this stope was abandoned. The
stope leads to a chamber to the west and the dark mine is east.

A smaller stope has been burrowed to the north off the western stope. The
timbers seem soggy here and are likely to collapse at any point.

    High mountain walls rise far above you to the west and south. Sheer and
high, they offer little hope of being scaled. To the north are enormous
boulders, equally unscalable due to the smoothness of their weathered grey
surfaces. Eastwards a passage winds its way beside the forest of massive
boulders, and westwards a passage leads towards a large mountain.

    A small narrow path is here. The walls to your north and south are steep
and rise for several hundred feet. The floor of this canyon is a mixture of
water worn bedrock and piles of gravel and rounded cobbles. To the east, the
dwarves of Thorbardin have taken advantage of this and constructed an
unscalable wall to protect their keep. The path winds its way east, into the
heart of the mountain.

    The blue and green stained walls shine as the moisture drips from them. A
small trickle of water flows down the slope, quietly eroding the rock. Sharp
pick marks show the work of the dwarves who mined this tunnel. A chill runs

rises sharply up and bends to the north here.

    To your east, the roughly hewn tunnel extends into the darkness. It bends
around a corner to the south. You are at the end of this tunnel. A dark void
of space extends out before you. The air is heavy and damp. A small trickle
of water that flows down the tunnel splashes over the side and you can hear
it land in a body of water. The high moisture in the air creates a fog that
prevents any penetration of your light sources. You can retreat to the tunnel
or step blindly off the cliff, into the unknown...
