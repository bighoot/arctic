You ran up charges of 345 steel in rent.

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

[35mThe Inn of Myth[0;37m
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

north, these fields are known as Nearfields to the citizens of Solace
because of their proximity to the small town. A thick forest of pine trees
lies to the west, beyond which the Crystalmir Lake can be seen. To the east
this dirt trail merges with a wide road.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a neighboring
vallenwood tree.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Looking around as you cross the immense stone bridge, you gaze in awe
at a pair of huge pillars of stone. The pillars seem to be the main
foundation of the structure, keeping it a safe distance from the raging
waters below. Even from here, you can hear the roar from the river below as
it crashes into the pillars and is forced around them. The stone bridge
stretches northward, high above the river, but the southern bank is still
reassuringly nearby.

is quite dangerous and only the largest of ferries are capable of being

Haven. Around you the landscape is dotted with trees and the area is hilly.
In the air you can faintly smell salt, carried by a breeze blowing from the

hear the sounds of a bustling town and to the north you hear a low rumbling.

[36mNorthgate[0;37m
    You find yourself at the beginning of a mountain pass leading into the
Kharolis mountains if you are heading south. This region is known to the
dwarves as Northgate, for it signals the northern entrance into their
mountainous domain. South of here the mountains grow taller and the road
leads to the mountain tops. To the north and east you can see forested
foothills and to the distant west more mountains are visible.

a steep, but usable path leads down to the road near Tarsis.

    The air is chilly and the landscape seems almost sick due to the
constant struggle with the cold harsh winds. Trees are stunted and gnarly,
large rocks have left impact marks on the valley floor and have cut paths
of destruction as they hurled down the valley walls. The road picks its
way carefully along, leading to the south entrance of the pass and deeper
into the mountains.

quite narrow and large boulders on the valley floor serve as a reminder of
the dangers of mountain travel.

silently thrust into the sky, as if they were literally challenging the Gods
of Krynn for possession of the sky. To your south, the landscape changes to
a dry and cold desert with scoured gullies and rocky crags. To the north
lies a very narrow pass and the only way through these mountains.

mighty cliffs, defiant against the cold, harsh winds, and dwarfed only by
the fifty foot towers that nearly encircle the city. The ancient city walls
have withstood the tests of time, including the Cataclysm in all of its
fiery glory. Once called Tarsis the Beautiful, the Lordcity was a bustling
sea port, whose rich commerce brought sustainability and prosperity to the
land. The city now looks as desolate as the plains that surround it.
Tempestuous winds assail the walls with endless specks of sand, causing
minimal damage to the walls, but serving as a constant reminder that
nothing can survive forever in these wastelands.

    This, the road to Tarsis, strides boldly through the Plains of Dust,
plunging eastward through the plains and west towards the exotic city of
Tarsis. Glacial winds gust in from the south, hampering your journey. The
plains respond to these forceful winds, born in the heart of Icewall, with
incredible dust storms that constantly threaten to encroach upon Tarsis and
the roads leading to her. Very few plants have the will or tenacity to try
growing on these rocky soils, and the slightest green of a stubborn moss is

    The path turns to the east and south, continuing along the edge of the
Forest of Silvanesti. The peaceful feeling of being in such close proximity
to the hustle and bustle of a live forest provides you with enough energy
to keep your feet light on the path. To the east, the trail continues on 
towards the deserts of Khur. To the north, the plains of Blode are in view
with the backdrop of mountains beyond. The Khalkist mountain range fills the
horizon to the north.

careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only
option is to continue either north or south.

    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.
