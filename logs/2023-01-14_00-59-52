You ran up charges of 81 steel in rent.

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

[35mThe Inn of Myth[0;37m
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

Spell    : Gate
Sphere   : Summoning
Usage    : cast 'gate' [name of demon]
Duration : Variable
Effects  : Summon a extra-planar creature or demon

The gate spell will summon a demon from another plane of existence, and
attempt to charm the foul creature into doing your willing.
Many varieties of creatures and demons exist, each alignment has their own
demons to enthrall.  Below are the lists of names per alignment:

Good:     Xia, Acadia, Shiroc, Aspasia, Antioch
Neutral:  Chanticlir, Chaldrun, Chi, Chaun, Chakan
Evil:     Vrock, Hezrou, Glabrezu, Nalfeshnee, Marilith

Providing the demon name (or partial name) as part of the spell will bring
forth that demon. The only exception to this rule is for un-aligned clerics
(neutral chaotic), they will randomly get a demon of any alignment, but have
no control over which they get. Not providing a name will give you a random
demon to which you have access.

The demon may be ordered just as one would order a charmed person/creature.
The length of duration of charm is dependent on intelligence of demon summoned
and the number of demons already following the caster.

Details:
- Utility spell which summons a follower to assist the caster.
- Good followers grant aura of +1 5th or 7th slot and PROTECT_EVIL.
- Neutral followers grant aura of RESIST_MAGIC and IMMUNE_NEGATIVE_ENERGY.
- Evil followers grant aura of CHA bonus and PROTECT_GOOD.

[35mThe Halls of Myth[0;37m
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

This thing looks like an eight foot tall man with the head of a dog. Its arms
end in large pincers, and, coming out of its chest, it has a second set of
smaller arms which end in normal human hands. Its lower legs and feet,
however, are those of a dog. With a snarl, it glares all around. It looks
nasty.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

This is a huge, hideous creature indeed. It stands twelve feet tall at the
shoulder. It has the massive torso of a man, and stunted, puny legs ending
in cloven hooves. Its arms are muscular, reaching to the ground, and ending
in powerful and extremely large fists. Its head is that of a warthog, with
glowing red eyes which show a glint of intelligence. It looks nasty.
The demon Nalfeshnee is in an excellent condition.

    Weaving its way around a corner of the lake, this small trail runs
between Crystalmir and a dense forest of pine. Lights filter through the
thick pines to your southeast from the village of Solace, flickering from
the many torches that light the roads there. The thick pines block any
exits to the south or east, while to the north and west this trail
continues along the lakeshore.

Lake, which juts into the land at the north and stretches out far to the

forest, the soft lap of the water against the lakeshore, and the rustle of
small animals across the forest floor. You see this trail leads south
along the shoreline into the darkness, and to the east where it rounds
another bend of the lake.

and sturdy. Large enough for passage of two wagons side by side, the bridge
barely feels the affects of the wind and water. A dwelling can be seen off
to north on a small island, nestled into a massive vallenwood tree. South
of here lies the shores of lake Crystalmir.

positioned on the island. Built in the boughs of a vallenwood with siding
of dark stained vallenwood planks this mansion has been built to mimic the
architecture of nearby Solace.

of a dome is supported by large vallenwood beams and provides ample
coverage to shield the stairway from the elements. Off to the south a
