You ran up charges of 251 steel in rent.

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

[35mThe Inn of Myth[0;37m
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the south. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and the gate is placed
between them. The forest to the south looks much wilder and more dangerous
than the forest that houses Solace. Southern Avenue leads north into

    The street gently curves as it follows the strong vallenwood wall that
marks the town's western border. A sturdy guard tower stands above you with
constant lookouts maintained at all hours of the day. To the south, a small
chapel has been built from the finest oak timbers in the land and it stands
majestically above the other buildings in this town. The street swings north
to the west gate and curves gently to the southeast.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,

the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors

north, these fields are known as Nearfields to the citizens of Solace
because of their proximity to the small town. A thick forest of pine trees
lies to the west, beyond which the Crystalmir Lake can be seen. To the east
this dirt trail merges with a wide road.

the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    This is a small tavern but filled to the brim with rowdy customers that
are both loud and drunk. Stale ale and bowls of musty broth are served by a
couple of wenches, occasionally having to fend off a few wandering hands. A
small fireplace lies in the north wall providing little light as most of
the corners of the tavern are shrouded in darkness.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    This is a small tavern but filled to the brim with rowdy customers that
are both loud and drunk. Stale ale and bowls of musty broth are served by a
couple of wenches, occasionally having to fend off a few wandering hands. A
small fireplace lies in the north wall providing little light as most of
the corners of the tavern are shrouded in darkness.

some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
