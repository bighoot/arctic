GYPSY CAMP
==========

BACKGROUND:

From time to time, gypsies move across the land and settle in small
communities of wagons. Being folk of the land, they are quite adept at
keeping their camps safe from prying eyes, and prefer to live peacefully away
from civilization. Though rarely seen, gypsys are generally regarded to be
kind and have an elfish ability to mingle with nature and likewise are
usually shy of people. Should someone with a corrupted heart happen upon a
gypsy camp, it is likely that the gypsies would be easily seized or disposed
of, as they are not known as fighters... although some are rumored to study
magics..

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The lack of defensive organization in a gypsy camp would probably make it
quite easy for a lone adventurer of low-mid levels [5-10] to wreak havoc on
the gypsies, though to explore the mysterious camps thoroughly you would
be well advised to travel with a companion or two.

LOCATION:
Gypsies have lately been spotted dealing their wares near the town of Neraka,
and this would be the best area to focus your search while looking for a
camp.

383H 162V 1251552X 21.08% 6055C [Pos:standing]Exits:NS> help reboot

All the mobiles you see in the game are temporary.  An object is
'permanent' only if it is rented.  They exist only in the memory of the
computer while it runs the mud.  A 'reboot' kills the mud, and starts
it again.  Thus all mobs, and non-rented objects, are destroyed and the
world starts 'fresh'.  A proper reboot includes saving all the
characters (it is as if you rented with whatever you are currently
carrying), and saving any creation in progress (for the creators).
Reboots are 'safe' and you are usually given a warning that one is
going to occur.  A reboot currently takes about 15 minutes to complete.

Crashes on the other hand are not safe.  A 'crash' is when something
goes wrong in the mud, and it cannot recover on its own.  Usually it
can recover by killing itself and starting over.  When a crash happens,
your character may not be saved properly.  Every 60 seconds the mud
saves each mortal character and their equipment (as if you rented).  If
a crash occurs, when you reconnect you may have lost up to 59 seconds
of playing.  Creation is not saved on any regular schedule; it is up to
the creator to ensure that everything is saved.

A shutdown is usually done for planned power outages or for the code to
be updated.  The same procedure is followed as if the system were to
be rebooted.  However, the time for the game to come back online will
vary greatly.

Arctic has a policy of "no reimbursements".  In general we cannot prove
whether you had the items you claim you did or not.  So the only objective
solution is to not reimburse anything.  We apologize.
