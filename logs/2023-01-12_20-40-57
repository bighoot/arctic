    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

[36mThe Tavern Square[0;37m
    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort

    The bank of Balifor looks fairly rundown. Not surprising, since the
local populace doesn't earn enough money to bother putting it in banks.
Still, the bank teller, shuttered up behind a reinforced glass window and
door, looks enthusiastic enough. A small sign has been stuck to the desk.

    You are on the main shopping street of Port Balifor. To the west you
hear shouts as the shopkeepers make their living. Traders square lies to
the east. From the north comes the heat of a furnace and the sound of
clanging metal. Heavy steel shutters to the south are the main defense of
the bank of Balifor.

[36mTraders Square[0;37m
    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.
