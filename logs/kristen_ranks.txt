[36mHall Between the Brass Doors[0;37m
    The hall is actually a natural rift in the rock's structure. Buckled
stone surrounds you. The floor seems to be made of hard packed mud. Long
poled torches burn in the four corners of the hall, blowing slightly in the

though much smaller, door is set in the southern wall.

    The natural cavern rises up around you. The rock walls are jagged, but
look scalable. The floor seems to be made of hard packed mud. A stagnant
pool of water settles to the north of the room while a big brass door is to
the south. Four iron chandeliers hang from the ceiling, illuminating the
    cavern.

[36mNorth Entrance of Sentinel Gap[0;37m
    You find yourself high in the Kharolis mountains. It is very cold and
very windy. The air is thin and you find it hard to breathe. This is the
beginning of the Sentinel Gap, a high mountain pass through the Kharolis
mountains. The road through the pass is well maintained and paved with
cobblestone. This is Seeker land and that explains why there is even a road
going through such an unpleasant area. During the winter, heavy snowfalls
can block this pass making travel impossible. South, the pass leads you
through the Kharolis mountains and onto Haven. North, the road leads
steadily down into the foothills and the forest of Solace.

of here, you can see the mighty vallenwood trees towering above the trees
of this forest. It is rumored that the lost mines, where Solace villagers
have gotten lost, are north of here. To the south of here and east, across
the Solace River, the strange forests of Darken Wood stand.

    The bridge is quite old but very sturdy. It is built with strong
vallenwood beams and piles and filled with stones culled from the Solace
River. Looking below, you can see the water gushing and foaming over the
rocks below. Occasionally, you see the flash of silver as a fish tries to
ascend the rapids into Crystalmir Lake. The road leads west into the
Sentinal Peaks and east along a narrow path to Solace.

    Here on the shore of the lake the tall pine trees that grow to the
south, cast shadows upon the lake's reflective surface. In the serene clear
water of the lake the dark silhouettes of fish is visible as they swim in
the shallow water to the west. Small rocks and gravel lie scattered about
the shoreline and waves gently lap the bank here creating swirling patterns
upon the sand. A blanket of fallen pine needles lie here in the sand and
dirt, that have fallen from the many tall pine trees in the area. The rocky
shoreline continues to the north, and to the east, the beach of the lake
lies.

    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to

overall feeling of peace and of tranquility seems to permeate the entire
temple. A small spiral stairway leads down out of the temple and into
Solace.

[36mEastern Avenue[0;37m
    The road is cut from among the huge vallenwoods which protect and house
the inhabitants of Solace. The limbs overhead entwine with one another to
provide a canopy of green foliage which filters out the heat of the sun,
while allowing dim light to shine through. One particularly large
vallenwood stands at the edge of the road. Looking up into it, you notice a
rather large temple is nestled among the limbs. A small stairway spirals
down around the trunk and ends at the road, providing an entry to the
temple. The road itself leads east deeper into the forest and west towards
Solace Square.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

[36mSouthern Avenue[0;37m
    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

travellers lose sight of Solace and civilization. It is amazing that one
could be so close to town, but feel completely lost in the wilderness.

    This road has no over-growth on it, indicating that it is fairly well
travelled. However, you don't notice much traffic along it. To either side
of the road stretches a vast forest of huge vallenwood trees. The road runs
east-west, and to the west, the forest opens up. A large poster can be seen
nailed to a nearby tree.

    This road has no over-growth on it, indicating that it is fairly well
travelled. However, you don't notice much traffic along it. To either side
of the road stretches a vast forest of huge vallenwood trees. The road
itself runs east-west.

    Stepping off the path into the forest, the trees become more densely
packed. There are several types of bushes and plants growing on the forest
floor. On a large tree to the east you notice moss has begun to make a
home on withering bark. Mushrooms dominate the forest floor, offering
critters a hallucinogenic food source. To the north a loud hum is audible.

[36mAbove a Buzzing Hive[0;37m
    The trees thin out to some degree here, letting plenty of sunshine
rain down upon the forest floor. A grist of bees has made this sunny patch
of ground its home. Many flowers bloom in the area, a product of the
pollination of the bees. Some flowering bushes are also present. The
entrance to the hive is large enough for a human to slip through. The
forest extends in all directions.

[36mEntrance to the Hive[0;37m
    The hive walls are made up of a myriad of honeycombs. With walls over
fifteen feet high, the sheer size of this place is staggering. The pulsing
hum of the buzzing of the thousands of bees working here makes a nearly
hypnotic sound. There is a clear passage through the hive to the south. A
small pathway winds its way up to the surface of the forest floor.

[36mThrough the Honeycomb[0;37m
    This hive is massive. Looking upward thousands of honeycombs form
walls of dripping honey. Bees buzz about doing their various jobs, paying
no attention to passersby. The path continues to the south. To the north
the entrance of the hive is visible.

[36mThe Heart of the Hive[0;37m
    After navigating through the honeycomb tunnel, the heart of the hive
has been reached. Honeycombs riddle the walls, giving a golden shine and
sweet smell to the room. Many bees have gathered here to accomplish their
genetically assigned jobs. There are two large chambers to the east and
west. To the west there is a din of buzzing, while to the east it is near
silent.

[36mA Throne Room[0;37m
    The rhythmic buzz that carries through the rest of hive is quieted
here. A stark contrast to the rest of the hive, there is no honeycomb
lining the wall. A raised dias rises in the middle of the room. On top of
the dias lies a massive golden throne, large enough for a huge bee. The
chamber, with its narrow entrance, seems to be designed with the defense
of the occupants in mind.

[36mThe Heart of the Hive[0;37m
    After navigating through the honeycomb tunnel, the heart of the hive
has been reached. Honeycombs riddle the walls, giving a golden shine and
sweet smell to the room. Many bees have gathered here to accomplish their
genetically assigned jobs. There are two large chambers to the east and
west. To the west there is a din of buzzing, while to the east it is near
silent.

[36mThrough the Honeycomb[0;37m
    This hive is massive. Looking upward thousands of honeycombs form
walls of dripping honey. Bees buzz about doing their various jobs, paying
no attention to passersby. The path continues to the south. To the north
the entrance of the hive is visible.

[36mEntrance to the Hive[0;37m
    The hive walls are made up of a myriad of honeycombs. With walls over
fifteen feet high, the sheer size of this place is staggering. The pulsing
hum of the buzzing of the thousands of bees working here makes a nearly
hypnotic sound. There is a clear passage through the hive to the south. A
small pathway winds its way up to the surface of the forest floor.

[36mAbove a Buzzing Hive[0;37m
    The trees thin out to some degree here, letting plenty of sunshine
rain down upon the forest floor. A grist of bees has made this sunny patch
of ground its home. Many flowers bloom in the area, a product of the
pollination of the bees. Some flowering bushes are also present. The
entrance to the hive is large enough for a human to slip through. The
forest extends in all directions.

    The road is cut from among the huge vallenwoods which protect and house
the inhabitants of Solace. The limbs overhead entwine with one another to
provide a canopy of green foliage which filters out the heat of the sun,
while allowing dim light to shine through. One particularly large
vallenwood stands at the edge of the road. Looking up into it, you notice a
rather large temple is nestled among the limbs. A small stairway spirals
down around the trunk and ends at the road, providing an entry to the
temple. The road itself leads east deeper into the forest and west towards
Solace Square.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

that you can almost feel the waves lapping at your feet. You can't help but
wonder if when the tides come in the road will be covered. Maybe the tides
are the reason for the large number or stones that can be seen to the east.

    Directly to your south, a road enters the settlement of Hamilton. Based
on its location along the northern shore of the Straits of Schallsea, you
can only assume that the economy of this village revolves around the fish
that are harvested daily. Most of the buildings look quiet shabby, so
unless this is your destination, you will probably want to just continue
down the road.

    The packed dirt road you are occupying stretches north towards the
citadel of Caergoth, while to the south it penetrates deeper into the
farmed lands of Southlund. Speaking of farms, to the east there is a small
path leading to a small white house with a red barn behind it, while to the
west a small fence separates you from a herd of cattle standing around a
bale of hay eating.

the tunnel, ready to slide into place to reinforce the doors. North leads
into a grassy courtyard, beyond that the Paladine fountain sprays water
high into the air.

glow seems to emanate from the altar and light the room. The room itself is
completely white. Marble tiles form the floor, they are clean and
reflective. The walls are made of stone blocks that have been painted
white. There is not even a speck of dirt in the corners of the room. A
hallway leads off to the south, towards the entrance to the temple and to
the north is a smaller room.

[36mEastern Paladine Way[0;37m
    You are standing at one of Caergoth's busiest intersections, so its
wise to decide which way you want to go before the traffic carries you in
the opposite direction. People mill about on their way to work or to do
some shopping, farmers lead their horses behind them on their way to the
market, merchants pull small hand carts along looking for a sale, you fight
your way through the throngs of people. The worn cobblestones of Paladine
Way continues to the east and west while a path to the docks lead to the
north and a path through the old town leads south. You detect the smell of
sawed wood drifting in through the gate to the east.

    You are on some heavy wrought iron stairs. It might be wise to pay
attention to where you step, because they appear to be quite slick and it
looks like it could be a long fall. The steps lead up into a dark corridor
or down to a small room where you can see a solitary candle burning.

[36mEastern Paladine Way[0;37m
    You are standing at one of Caergoth's busiest intersections, so its
wise to decide which way you want to go before the traffic carries you in
the opposite direction. People mill about on their way to work or to do
some shopping, farmers lead their horses behind them on their way to the
market, merchants pull small hand carts along looking for a sale, you fight
your way through the throngs of people. The worn cobblestones of Paladine
Way continues to the east and west while a path to the docks lead to the
north and a path through the old town leads south. You detect the smell of
sawed wood drifting in through the gate to the east.

the plains eventually winding its way to the beautiful city of Palanthas.
The road also leads east through the village of Restglen on its way to Port
o'Call. A small path leads west along the coast of the Straits of
Schallsea.

    A small, fairly rough road winds north and south through the vallenwood
forest. It goes up and down among the hills of the region. Often,
travellers lose sight of Solace and civilization. It is amazing that one
could be so close to town, but feel completely lost in the wilderness.

[36mEastern Avenue[0;37m
    The road is cut from among the huge vallenwoods which protect and house
the inhabitants of Solace. The limbs overhead entwine with one another to
provide a canopy of green foliage which filters out the heat of the sun,
while allowing dim light to shine through. One particularly large
vallenwood stands at the edge of the road. Looking up into it, you notice a
rather large temple is nestled among the limbs. A small stairway spirals
down around the trunk and ends at the road, providing an entry to the
temple. The road itself leads east deeper into the forest and west towards
Solace Square.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

ground is covered with various animal skins that muffle the sound of your
steps. A firepit sits in the center of the hut, the smoke escapes through a
hole in the ceiling. Hanging on the walls are various bits of the shaman's
craft - feathers, bones and containers of all sorts. An awful smell
emanates from a pot on the fire, you wonder if it is dinner or a potion.

    The narrow bough comes to an end here. The new school of magic lies to
the west, while strange chanting can be heard from the north. A hut built
from sewn patches of animal skins stretched across the vallenwood branches
lie to the east. A small grove can be seen at the base of the tree, as a
small branch slopes gently down from here providing passage. Finally, the
bough moves back toward the trunk to the south.

you hear and smell signs of Solace, but the thick foliage prevents you from
actually being able to see it. The road leads east and west here.

    This settlement is the last stop for the trade caravans before they
split up to take some of their goods to Caergoth while others take their
wares to the port city of Port o'Call on the shores of the Newsea. These
caravans would normally head toward the main road just west of here on
their way to Caergoth and Port o'Call. A small path ends in the heart of
the settlement. To the south a small sign portraying the three moons stands
beside a small door.

    The road through the plains of Solamnia runs along the outskirts of the
settlement of Harrying. The road continues north towards Vingaard and south
along the coast to Port o'Call. A smaller road leads into the heart of the
settlement to the east. The smell of lilacs and roses hangs in the air
here. As you pause to enjoy the odors, you notice the road through Harrying
is not as crowded as you would think it would be. This settlement is the
last stop for the trade caravans before they split up to take some of their
goods to Caergoth while others take their wares north of the Vingaard
River.

    Winding its way across the windy and fertile Solamnic plains, the
highway stretches far to the north and to the south. Merchants slowly make
their way across the plains supplying the cities of Solamnia with goods
from the other corners of the world. Endless plains surround the highway,
almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and weeds. The wind
brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire. The loud sound of
the New Sea's waves crashing against the land can be heard far to the
south, where several gulls can barely be seen.

the tunnel, ready to slide into place to reinforce the doors. North leads
into a grassy courtyard, beyond that the Paladine fountain sprays water
high into the air.

    You are standing at one of Caergoth's busiest intersections, so its
wise to decide which way you want to go before the traffic carries you in
the opposite direction. People mill about on their way to work or to do
some shopping, farmers lead their horses behind them on their way to the
market, merchants pull small hand carts along looking for a sale, you fight
your way through the throngs of people. The worn cobblestones of Paladine
Way continues to the east and west while a path to the docks lead to the
north and a path through the old town leads south. You detect the smell of
sawed wood drifting in through the gate to the east.

The heavy wooden gates, reinforced with iron bars, look equally aged but
still strong enough to hold off an attack from the harbor. The smell of

enough to make you gag. To the south the tunnel leads into the heart of the

    This is a tavern, well not just any tavern. Sailors worldwide talk
about this place. You spot the bartender behind the bar and you see several
patrons guzzling down their drinks. Paintings of beautiful women that could
keep your attention for hours line the walls, but the main attraction is
the small stage and its occupant. You can leave to the north if you would
like...but why not stay for a drink or two?

looks on the knight's faces you wonder if you shouldn't just turn around
and head back to town.

    Standing here on the Caergothian docks, you can't help but want to
board one of the ships. But when you think of the months you would have to
spend at sea with no dry land in sight, you get a little queasy. Maybe you
should return to the bar and get some ale to settle your stomach. From here
you can follow the pier to the north where you see a ship with a very
strange sail, you could follow the pier to the west where you see a
Solamnic warship docked, or you can return south towards the city.

exoctic lands. As some sailors pass you by, you over hear them reminiscing
about a battle they had with some pirates. It might be wiser for you to
return to the bar, and reminisce about playing pirates in your tree house

and traders have walked these docks. Speaking of sailors, there are several
stumbling around looking for the way back to their ships. To the north and

the north and west you can see a trading ship with some odd sails and a
solamnic warship at dock.

    The tunnel leading through the stone walls of the city displays just
how thick the walls are. The walls are about twenty feet thick near the
gates and appear to shrink down to about ten feet away from the gates. The
stones forming the arch above you look worn by the winds of ages gone by.
The heavy wooden gates, reinforced with iron bars, look equally aged but
still strong enough to hold off an attack from the harbor. The smell of
rotting fish blows in with the breeze coming from the docks and is strong
enough to make you gag. To the south the tunnel leads into the heart of the

wise to decide which way you want to go before the traffic carries you in
the opposite direction. People mill about on their way to work or to do
some shopping, farmers lead their horses behind them on their way to the
market, merchants pull small hand carts along looking for a sale, you fight
your way through the throngs of people. The worn cobblestones of Paladine
Way continue to the east and west while the path to the Port Gate leads to
the north and a path through the residential district leads south. The odor
of fermenting grapes can be detected faintly in the salty breeze that blows
across your face from the west.

some vineyards as it meanders its way to the Straits Algoni. From the south
comes the smell of fermenting grapes, while to the north a path leads to an

    Pouring from the top of a cliff, a waterfall plunges downward into a
small pool. A small creek heads north from the pool and joins with the
harbor. A small stretch of shoreline starts here and continues a short
distance to the west. Looking at how small it is compared to the vastness
of the sea, makes you think about how small you are in the grand scheme of
things. Towering above you stands the walls of Caergoth. You might be able
to make it up there by heading up the cliffside. Just to the east of you,
you see a very narrow and steep 'path' that might allow one to get up the
cliff.

[36mFording the Vingaard River[0;37m
    The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal
place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,
scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

[36mThe West Bank[0;37m
    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

visible perched atop a hill with the city's walls nearby. The road
continues north to a junction of roads from other parts of the continent
and a small tollhouse that stands watch over the intersection. To the
south, the road crosses the Vingaard River via a ford in the river.

road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

collect taxes from travellers passing through. Northward the road heads to
the east gate of Vingaard City, and to a ferry crossing the river.

    Winding its way through the windy and fertile Plains, the highway
stretches to the east and to the west, escaping the horizon. Quiet and
depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the highway, their
heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the
highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and weeds.
The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire.

    The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

the western city gates of Kalaman, to the west it leads deeper into the
fields, and toward the river.

    Just beyond the western gates of Kalaman, the trail splits into two
paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off to
the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.

foolish enough to travel through this evil country. The road leads up

cresting over the low protective wall that encircles the town. Nestled
close to the black beast of the Khalkists, the town looks truly fitting in
such a dark place. The road leads off to the north, leading through the

towards the peaks of the Khalkists. Out to the west, the foothills cover
the badlands, leaving no sign of habitation in their midst.

[36mIn View of a Dark City[0;37m
    The road cuts through the mighty Khalkists, covered in the prints of
many boots. The road leads north past the heart of the Khalkists and south
towards the dark city of Neraka. The mountain range looms high above,
craggy and barren. Birds of prey can be seen hovering above, waiting for
the carnage of war. The air is filled with a thick film, possibly coming
from one of the semi-active volcanoes in the region.

[36mBefore the City of Neraka[0;37m
    The dark city of Neraka spreads out to the south, the dark minions of
Takhisis filling the streets. A twisted dark spire rises in the middle of
the city, the pinnacle of the Queen's temple. The craggy peaks of the
Khalkist mountains rise around the city, adding their shadows to the film
of ash that floats through the air.

almost completely lost in shadow. The roughly hewn cobbles are covered with
filth and trash, and the path probably hasn't been cleaned in months. More

encases what appears to be a large training camp to the north. Clouds of
dust rise up into the sky from activities within, kicked up from the ground
and carried off by the blustering wind. Numerous stone structures seem to
be built within the camp's boundaries but the majority of the grounds seem
to be occupied by a central training area. An opening in the thick steel
fence line offers entrance to the White Dragonarmy training facility,
though unwelcome intrusions are probably met with swift serves of violence.

    Although the furnishings in this humble stone barracks are plain, it
would appear the dragonarmy recruits have tried to liven it up somewhat. A
series of makeshift dart boards have been hung along the northern wall
which are riddled with plain iron darts, probably constructed by the camp's
resident blacksmith. Tables and chairs take up most of the space in the
room to allow the recruits to sit while they eat, though many of the chairs
seem to have been partially broken. Thick aromas of roasted meat waft in
from the kitchen to the south of the barracks, while the the quarters
connected to the west seems to be slightly quieter.

    A tall black fence line draped with the banners of the White Dragonarmy
encases what appears to be a large training camp to the north. Clouds of
dust rise up into the sky from activities within, kicked up from the ground
and carried off by the blustering wind. Numerous stone structures seem to
be built within the camp's boundaries but the majority of the grounds seem
to be occupied by a central training area. An opening in the thick steel
fence line offers entrance to the White Dragonarmy training facility,
though unwelcome intrusions are probably met with swift serves of violence.

[36mA Spartan Stone Barracks[0;37m
    Although the furnishings in this humble stone barracks are plain, it
would appear the dragonarmy recruits have tried to liven it up somewhat. A
series of makeshift dart boards have been hung along the northern wall
which are riddled with plain iron darts, probably constructed by the camp's
resident blacksmith. Tables and chairs take up most of the space in the
room to allow the recruits to sit while they eat, though many of the chairs
seem to have been partially broken. Thick aromas of roasted meat waft in
from the kitchen to the south of the barracks, while the the quarters
connected to the west seems to be slightly quieter.

[36mA Greasy Kitchen[0;37m
    Thick, humid air swirls through this small kitchen carrying the scents
of roasted meat and burning fat. A serious lack of ventilation along with
the heavy cooking workload required to feed the resident recruits has lead
to the rough stone walls being covered with a slick layer of grease. A
large fire pit has been dug out of the stone floor in the centre of the
kitchen which has a charred black spit resting over it, allowing whole
animals to be cooked over the open fire. A small pile of bones lies against
the southern wall of the room which have been completely picked clean,
inferring whoever runs this kitchen also eats in it themselves.

[36mA Hidden Campsite[0;37m
    The thick bushes and shrubs that dominate this area have been cleared
away slightly to create this small campsite, which is extremely well hidden
amongst the thick flora growing around it. The distant sounds of heavy
marching and violent combat still echo through the air from the White
Dragonarmy training camp nearby, though the noise is somewhat dampened by
the thick foliage. A large brown log rests on the sandy ground in the
centre of the area just a few feet from a small campfire, which although it
does not provide as much heat as one might desire cannot be any bigger, or
it would risk drawing attention to the existance of this hidden sanctuary.

    This small building has been converted from a household residence into
a small smithy for the resident blacksmith to ply his trade in, crafting
weapons and armour for the local dragonarmy recruits. The stone walls have
been adorned with large iron racks which are laden with a variety of
charred metal tools that seem to have no real method to their storage.
Constructed against the northern wall of the building is an enormous stone
forge where metal is heated to extreme temperatures so that it can be
beaten into shape on the large steel anvil that rests in the centre of the
room. Humid, sweaty air hangs in the room like a moist fog, evidence of
hard labour taking place in swelteringly hot conditions.

    Thick dust covers the floor of the training grounds which swirls
through the air when it is kicked up by dragonarmy recruits honing their
combat skills. Wooden training dummies crafted to loosely resemble a
humanoid figure are scattered through the area, covered with large notches
and gouges where metal weapons have bit deep into their timber. Marring the
dust covered ground are a few splashes of crimson, most likely dried blood
that was spilt during heated sparring sessions. The dusty training grounds
continues to extend outwards to the west and south, and an iron gate to the
east leads into a dusty wooden building.

be built within the camp's boundaries but the majority of the grounds seem
to be occupied by a central training area. An opening in the thick steel
fence line offers entrance to the White Dragonarmy training facility,

    Weaving its way around a corner of the lake, this small trail runs
between Crystalmir and a dense forest of pine. Squirrels chatter as they
dart from tree to tree in a frenetic chase, startling a red-headed
woodpecker into flight. The sunlight trickles through the forest of dense
evergreens, which cover the ground to the south and east. To the north and
west the sandy trail continues along the shoreline.

    The narrow trail rounds a corner here to avoid running into Crystalmir
Lake, which juts into the land at the north and stretches out far to the
west. The sun glints off the water, which ripples slightly as a pleasant
wind blows across it. Nattering squirrels can be heard in the forest of
pine stretching out to the southeast, beyond which the sounds of
civilization rise from the village of Solace. As the trail follows the
curve of the lake it heads south along the shoreline, and to the east where
it rounds another bend.

    The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal
place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,
scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

    The road here passes through some large fields of grain, a sign that a
large city is nearby. Looking westward, the towers of Vingaard Keep are
visible perched atop a hill with the city's walls nearby. The road
continues north to a junction of roads from other parts of the continent
and a small tollhouse that stands watch over the intersection. To the
south, the road crosses the Vingaard River via a ford in the river.
