[35mThe Inn of Myth[0;37m
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    To the north is a sheer drop off the side of the mountain. High winds
threaten to blow you off the side of the mountain and you quickly realize
that, even flying, your chances of surviving a step off the cliff would be
minimal. To the south, a small path between the keep and some boulders back
towards the main gate of the keep. Off to the west, a small ledge winds its
way between the keep walls and a sheer drop-off. It might be safe to go
that way, but you wonder if you should risk it. To the east, the winding
road leads down the mountain.

    Before you stand two huge brass gates which once guarded the entrance
to Thorbardin. However, a terrible earthquake has caused the passageway
beyond the gates to collapse, sealing off the entrance forever. The giant
gates have fallen off their hinges and lean forlornly against the piles of
rubble. Although the passage into the kingdom is destroyed, the indomitable
mountain known as Cloudseeker still stands, reaching towards the sky. To
the north and south, narrow paths lead around the cliffs surrounding the
mountain, and a sloping path to the east leads back down the mountain.

    The passage way between the mountain walls and the piles of boulders
is just wide enough for a fair-size adventuring party to pass through. The
boulders look unsteady and you would hate to have to climb up on them, but
thankfully don't look like there will be an avalanche. To the north, the
path opens up and you can see a set of ruined gates, while to the south,
the tight passageway continues through the barren mountain range.

Mountains, passing between a mountainside and jagged cliffs. To the south,
a steep, but usable path leads down to the road near Tarsis.

    Depending on which direction you're traveling, this is either the end
or the beginning of the Sixteenth Road. The Road is paved with cobbelstones
of pink granite that merge seamlessly into a giant, arching stone bridge
that spans the yawning chasm to the north. The south end of the road slopes
down and turns abruptly to wind down a huge spiral ramp. There is also a
small side street to the east which leads to a residential area.

This ancient dwarf has been serving her god for many, many years, and her
faith is as unwavering as ever. Despite her obvious old age, she is still
spry and nimble, with divine zeal for her god burning fervently in her eyes
like the fire of Reorx's forge. She wears both a crimson holy symbol and a
hooded robe of dark crimson wool, with runes stitched into its sleeves.
The high priestess of Reorx is in an excellent condition.

    This great hall is where the royal officers make major decisions about
justice that govern the whole kingdom of Thorbardin. As the dwarven society
is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the
god Reorx, this hall also functions as the dwarves' most holy temple. Giant
marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. Rubies in 
the ground lead towards the arched bridge to the holy altar to the west.

    An enormous anvil of red granite stands on a platform suspended over a
bottomless pit by four arching stone bridges holding it up. The runes of
divinity carved around the base of the anvil clearly indicate that it is an
altar to Reorx. The altar gleams proudly under the light of huge glittering
diamonds embedded in the domed black ceiling to resemble stars, arranged
like the constellations of Paladine and Takhisis circling each other. The
bridges lead off in each of the cardinal directions, but since the southern
part of the hall has caved in, the end of that bridge has been blocked.

    This great hall is where the royal officers make major decisions about
justice that govern the whole kingdom of Thorbardin. As the dwarven society
is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the
god Reorx, this hall also functions as the dwarves' most holy temple. Giant
marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. A pair of
massive bronze doors guard the entrance to the north, while rubies set into
the ground lead towards the arched bridge to the holy altar to the south.

[36mA Cluttered Square[0;37m
    This large square has been carefully carved out of the limestone, and
it was once a beautiful testament to dwarven stonework. Now, however, the
scratched stone floor is littered with loose gears, broken tools, random
screws and half-finished contraptions. The famed Hylar engineers must work
in the nearby buildings, perfecting the technology that the dwarves use to
defend their mountain home and keep their mighty kingdom running.

[36mLevel 10 Lift Station[0;37m
    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a dwarf steps off on
this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must
have fallen off contraptions being transported to other parts of the huge
mountain kingdom. Unlike gnomish parts, these spare parts are as finely
made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

this level to drop off a few gruff dwarven commoners. The area is fairly
clean except for some small piles of refuse, as if the garbage collectors
don't come by frequently enough. All of the massive stone archways leading
away from the lift station are plain and unadorned, but the archway to the
south appears to have been recently and permanently boarded up.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and almost every single one stops on
this level to drop off a few gruff dwarven commoners. The area is fairly
clean except for some small piles of refuse, as if the garbage collectors
don't come by frequently enough. All of the massive stone archways leading
away from the lift station are plain and unadorned, but the archway to the
south appears to have been recently and permanently boarded up.

the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a lift stops on this
level so that a well-dressed dwarf or two can step off. The station walls
are lined with platinum and gold panels, suggesting that the dwarves who
live here must be among the wealthiest in Thorbardin. Elaborate carvings
adorn the impressive doors set in the magnificent archways to the east and
south, while the door to the west has been permanently welded shut.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and the dwarves who disembark on this
level include representatives from many different clans. The station walls
are adorned with majestic sculptures that tell the stories how all of the
dwarven clans came together to found the mighty nation of Thorbardin. Each
of the four archways is carved in the style and stone of a different clan,
named by the plaques above them: Theiwar, Daewar, Daergar and Klar.

the chains in the transport shafts, and sometimes a lovestruck dwarven

from the station. The stone archways and walls are covered with cultivated
mushrooms arranged in beautiful fluorescent patterns. According to a large

PIRATE'S ISLAND
================

BACKGROUND:

The people of Flotsam are furious: many merchants have been sailing into
this famous port city, bringing with them only tales of pirates in the open
seas of Istar. One ship in particular has caused quite a ruckus - a large
minotaur vessel with a masthead of a raven, named the Pride o' Mithas.
Merchants have also noticed quite a bit of a stir on one of the unnamed
outlying islands in the Blood Sea of Istar, home to a large lighthouse of
unknown origin. The lighthouse itself has been there as long as any can
remember, but it until recently has been unoccupied.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

A group of high level [20+] adventurers would more than likely be able to
take control over most of the island, but to kill the pirate leader Mul, a
group of seasoned veterans [25+] would probably be best.

LOCATION:

The island is known to be in the Blood Sea of Istar, which is near the port
city of Flotsam. It would be wise to start looking for the island there.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this

Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from

[36mThe Northern Gate of Solace[0;37m
    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    The avenue twists and turns among the huge vallenwoods. Sounds of life
are all around you. Looking up, you see the sun peeking through the dense
canopy of the forest. As you walk among the forest life, you feel safe and
at ease. You see a large stone building to the east. The avenue continues
to the north and south. A small sign is posted on the stone building.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    The lands of Ak-Tubal and Kalin Ak-Phan stretch out to the east. They
are flat, dry, grassy plains infamous for their unbearable heat during the
summer solstice. Although the conditions can be harsh, you can see several
clumps of hardwoods providing some shade for travellers. Far east beyond
the huge plains you can barely make out the glittering waves of the Khurman
Sea. The altitude descends north of there, though to the south you can see
the jagged, towering peaks of the mighty Khalkist Mountains.

Mountains which lay to the west. Lush, flat plains extend to the east and
northeast. These hills are green, dotted by the occasional dark grey
boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or
civilization can be seen in sight, as there are few footprints and no wagon
ruts on this rugged road.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool

the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

continues. The Deep Mine Main Shaft is the clear way back to the mountain
surface.

[36mJunction One[0;37m
    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

[36mBefore a Humble Inn[0;37m
    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

    Fabulous aromas assault the senses from all sides of this compact
kitchen. Over the fire-pit a huge pig is roasting slowly, while at the
stove bread bakes to a fine golden brown. A bookshelf on the southern wall
holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a
priest of Reorx. A window set on the northern wall is open, in the
unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,
while the backdoor of the Burrow is framed near the window.

Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

[36mInside a Huge Stalagmite[0;37m
    Dark gray walls climb to the ceiling of this massive stalagmite.
Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

moist air and smells that waft in from other areas of the stalagmite. This

    On both sides of a long dried path are huge puddles of a strangely
sweet-smelling mud. Thankfully, the path provides relief from the messy
mud-covered entrance of the stalagmite. Cloved prints pockmark the path,
too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room.
Stacked in a surprisingly organized pile to the north is a pile of
shattered armaboro hides. The path through the den leads to the east and
south. A terrifying odor seems to be wafting in from the east.

    On both sides of a long dried path are huge puddles of a strangely
sweet-smelling mud. Thankfully, the path provides relief from the messy
mud-covered entrance of the stalagmite. Cloved prints pockmark the path,
too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room.
Stacked in a surprisingly organized pile to the north is a pile of
shattered armaboro hides. The path through the den leads to the east and
south. A terrifying odor seems to be wafting in from the east.

    On both sides of a long dried path are huge puddles of a strangely
sweet-smelling mud. Thankfully, the path provides relief from the messy
mud-covered entrance of the stalagmite. Cloved prints pockmark the path,
too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room. The
path leads to the south and north, where a sickening smell seems to be
coming from.

    If the rest of the den is disgustingly muddy, this area encourages
vomit. A gigantic pile of armaboro excrement is heaped against the
northeast corner--a heavier shade of nasty than the mud. As well as the
stench is masked by the mud, the absolute reeking of shit is nearly
intolerable. In fact, if not for the mud's masking, it is likely that you'd
be passed out on the floor. Paths away from the mud lead to the south and

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

[36mBehind the Dragon's Skull[0;37m
    Mud puddles line a path, leading directly into the back of a giant
dragon's mouth. A small opening is easily visible between the skull and the
mandible. The mud here has a strange sweet smell that is surprisingly
pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem
terrifyingly bigger than the ones seen above. Most of the hoofprints seem
to be leading east, where the mud gets thicker.

[36mA Mud-filled Alcove[0;37m
    This tiny alcove is filled with the rich orange-tan mud seen throughout
the den of the armaboros. The bodyprints in this area suggest that it is an
area given mainly to the female beasts. Of course, since the females
congregate in this area, male armaboros, with breeding rights, will come
here to help propagate the species. The room to the south appears a little
less muddy.

Lefty flies in from the north.
[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

    This tiny alcove is filled with the rich orange-tan mud seen throughout
the den of the armaboros. The bodyprints in this area suggest that it is an
area given mainly to the female beasts. Of course, since the females
congregate in this area, male armaboros, with breeding rights, will come
here to help propagate the species. The room the north appears a little
less muddy.

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.

This giant, elder armaboro spends its final days near the spring. The
spring appears to give an amount of youth to the old pig, but even as it
strengthens him, it cuts days off of his life. Not dead yet, the giant
armaboro would be a dastardly opponent in combat. In fact, the only reason
he remains alive and in his current post is that he can still fend off the
other elder beasts.

[36mA Hot, Muddy Spring[0;37m
    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area
below.
