    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the

a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    This narrow, dirt road winds its way through the great forest, curving
around large trees and rocks. You can hear the chattering of hundreds of
animals all around you, and a few of the trees seem to have large claw
marks. To the south, lies the northern gate of Solace, and to the north,
the road continues. Large bushes block your view to the east and west.

    A narrow road leads deep into a thick forest of very tall trees and
north it leads through the plains of Abanasinia. Around you are many trees
but not as many as to the south. The road runs in the near shadows of the
Kharolis mountains which can be seen off to the west, beyond a great lake.
The mountains appear to run north for some distance before ending. The
plains spread out to the north from here for many leagues.

    You are on a narrow trail that cuts between large fields of grain and
the huge vallenwood trees that cover the Solace Vale. Stretching out to the
north, these fields are known as Nearfields to the citizens of Solace
because of their proximity to the small town. A thick forest of pine trees
lies to the west, beyond which the Crystalmir Lake can be seen. To the east
this dirt trail merges with a wide road.

south into thicker woods and north.

home comforts while a bar hastily built from what appears to be a whole
tree trunk occupies the far wall. The patrons do not seem to mind. Most are
drunk and rowdy, and you notice that all carry weapons of one sort or

intently at your purse. A doorway leads into a back room.

    The cruel sun beats down on the road here, cracking the dried soil.
The land here suffers badly from the unrelenting winds that blow across the
desert to the west. Lizards take shelter in the shadows of the rocks where
the sand is not hot enough to roast them, but there is no shade large
enough for larger animals. Each step sinks into the searing sand, the air
thick and hazy, each breath like drowning in lava.

    Several climates converge on the groves of trees loosely dotting the
grassy landscape here, and signs of wildlife can be seen all throughout
the area. The lush forests to the south evoke a sense of peacefulness.
Mountains line the horizon to the north and rolling deserts far to the
east, while thick tree cover to the south denotes the legendary forests of
Silvanesti. An unkempt trail lingers from moderate traffic to the east and
west.

    The trail continues to the east and west, along the edge of the Forest
of Silvanesti. Tall timbers line the sides of the path that creates a
quaint corridor effect. The trees seem to thin out here, giving way to a
more verdant landscape of various shrubbery. Animals trails intersect the
main path leading through the area. Mountain ranges are barely visible to
the north and to the east the terrain seems more rigid and bare. Traveling
here seems peaceful and unencumbered.

    The edge of a great forest lies to the south, filled with ancient
and beautiful trees, wildlife, and the revered home of the Silvanesti elves.
The trees and foliage provide an impassable barrier to entering the forest
from here, forming a natural border with the rest of the world. To the east
and west, a well travelled path continues east along the edge of the forest,
and west to an intersection. To the north, you can see the plains of Blode
in the distance, which are home to towns and cities alike.

careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only
option is to continue either north or south.

a ways off. The road becomes much larger here and to the north while to the
southeast it almost becomes buried in tall grasses. To the northwest you
can see the hills of Khuri Khan. The road skirts the sides of these rolling
hills which eventually merge with the lower, warmer hills of the Ek-Khan.

    This path skirts the hills of Khuri-Khan, a large system of dry, grassy
foothills. The hills gradually become steeper to the north, while to the
south the land flattens out somewhat. The road is made of mulch and looks
relatively well travelled as there are many wagon ruts and footprints from

against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Paper stacks litter the entire room, though you can't imagine that
somebody would leave all of it in chaos, it must have taken years to sort.
Amongst the papers are mostly what looks like forms for recruiting, they
contain little more than a name and assignment to training. In the middle
of the room a pine desk is flanked on both sides by more papers, and a
crude map drawn on browned parchment is tacked to the western wall.

    Thrifty blankets cover the stacked beds here, occasionally rising and

out from underneath the bottom bunks, their flimsy metal frames barely
protecting the recruits' only belongings. The barrack continues westward,
and to the south a stone archway leads into a twisting hall.

    Standing before double doors carved with the two common visages of
Takhisis, you are immediately struck by a powerful evil aura. Stone walls
meet up with a curved ceiling, and lead westward through a twisting
passage, while to the east the foreboding doors of a temple to the dark
goddess lie before you. Clearly the coward's way is to flee west away from
the danger within, though those who wish to follow in the footsteps of
heroes would surely brave on to the dangers of the temple.

    Narrow isles lead in between the wooden pews from north to south,

line the rows of pews from east to west, upon which Takhisis's acolytes
kneel to offer her dark prayers. Leading west is an entryway into a
hallway, occupied by two black wooden doors, one bearing a carving of a
beautiful woman and the other a hideous dragon with five heads.

The pages of the book quickly begin to smolder and crackle as you read
through them. Each page you finish turns instantly to ash and you struggle
to keep the book in your hands as they are engulfed in flames. Unable to
bear the pain any longer you drop the book to the ground and it quickly
turns to a pile of ash and ember. The hot flames speak to you in a calming

they fade.

from here, you can feel the breeze of freshly circulated air from the room

underground halls. To the north the hallway you are in, meets up with
another hallway running east-west.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    The road leads east to the city jail, the start of the journey for many
of the prisoners on death row. It is also their last. The dank smell of
rotting flesh and unwashed bodies is not very pleasant. You force yourself

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

[36mThe Tavern Square[0;37m
    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.
[33m[1m[0;37m[31m[1mA young kender stands here, looking about curiously.
A muscular watchman quietly patrols the streets of Port Balifor.
You sense that you are not alone.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the

    The rocky bend in the mountains is a sort of valley as the taller
mountain peaks all around slope downward. Loose boulders above give an
uneasy feeling, as the mountains funnel to this portion of the road. The
only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs
are unscalable. An indication of civilization comes in the form of a thin
netting that sits along the sloped cliffside to the west, preventing much
of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such
netting to the south.

    Cowering in the shadows of the black city walls, this cobbled path is
almost completely lost in shadow. The roughly hewn cobbles are covered with
filth and trash, and the path probably hasn't been cleaned in months. More
care has been taken in hewing the stones used to make the massive walls,
clearly showing where the city's priorities lie. A dreary gloom hangs over
the area, and it would be unwise to linger here longer than necessary. The
dirty cobblestone path continues to the east and west, while an ominously
narrow passage between the looming walls leads to the south from here. Off
to the north, a rocky path leads into the mighty Khalkist mountains.

[36mA Junction of Paths[0;37m
    The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

stretches to the east and to the west, escaping the horizon. Quiet and
depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the highway, their
heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the
highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and weeds.

    A small building has been built here, just north of the road. The
building is apparently there as a living area for the ferry's operators. A
small section of the building's roof extends out over the road to serve as
a place of waiting for the ferry. A small dock juts out into the flowing
waters of the Vingaard, a series of cleats along its edges to tie up the
ferry.

road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

[36mThe Northern Gate of Solace[0;37m
    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

north and south, while Perimeter Street appears to loop to the east,
circling above the region Solace is built in. What appears to be a gate is
to the north, while you see signs of Solace to the south.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from

    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

large waves and strong winds seem to cover much of this sea. The waters

[36mFording the Vingaard River[0;37m
    The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal
place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,
scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

[36mThe West Bank[0;37m
    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

large city is nearby. Looking westward, the towers of Vingaard Keep are
visible perched atop a hill with the city's walls nearby. The road
continues north to a junction of roads from other parts of the continent
and a small tollhouse that stands watch over the intersection. To the

    The clear waters of the Vingaard River gently flow northward, toward
Kalaman and the Northern Courrain Ocean. The river is fairly wide though
seems a bit narrower in this area, likely the reason a ferry was set up
here. Light shimmers off the water, dancing about the irregularities in the
water's usually smooth surface. A few fish can barely be seen swimming
about.

been heavily traveled, though a few weeds seem to be popping up. A small

dock juts out into the river for the ferry itself.
