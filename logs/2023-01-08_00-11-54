Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

    The walls in this portion of the stalagmite are very different from
those previously encountered. There are no smooth curves, bumps, or odd
colors. Coffee-colored walls surround this small cavern and capture the
moist air and smells that waft in from other areas of the stalagmite. This
bubble in the stalagmite appears to contain less moisture than the other
ones, but it still has collected several small puddles on the floor. Cloved
hoofprints can be found all over, none leading in any particular direction.

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural
wonderland.

    On both sides of a long dried path are huge puddles of a strangely
sweet-smelling mud. Thankfully, the path provides relief from the messy
mud-covered entrance of the stalagmite. Cloved prints pockmark the path,
too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room. The
path leads to the south and north, where a sickening smell seems to be
coming from.

proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the

heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side

    A slender tunnel branches off here from the 'Golden Lane' to the north.
Two transluscent carvings crafted by the Pyromancer's Guild refract white
light that is so intense it dazzles all those travelling through this
tunnel. Stunning gems of all colors absorbing the bright light of the
carvings adorn the walls of the tunnel here. There are no mansions on
either side of the passage here, but the tunnel continues to extend away
from the 'Golden Lane' with fierce light illuminating the path.

[36mThe End of the Golden Lane[0;37m
    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

    Amazingly bright, white light illuminates the 'lane' here, creating a
dramatic effect with the numerous jewels embedded into the buildings. In
this section of the alley, huge balconies seem to have become the trend.
Numerous couples seem to be enjoying fine wines and spirits, while eating
freshly barbequed meat. Here, laughing and happiness seem as common as they
do at the Burrow. The Golden Lane leads back toward the Main Way to the
east, and reaches its conclusion to the west.

[36mThe Golden Lane[0;37m
    While dubbed the 'Golden Lane', this slender tunnel-path hardly passes
as anything greater than an alley. And though completely extravagant, gold
is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

    In this residential area of Deep Mine, some homes have been dug
directly into the side of the tunnel. Against the western wall, however, a
large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.
Torches set near the ceiling, brighten this residential area.

side walls. Deep treads in the center of the road, indicate the path of the
mining carts to both the west and south. Mounted torches, light this region
from the ceiling down. The way south leads to a junction in the tunnel,

popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in

it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

    This rough road winds its way through foothills near the Khalkist
Mountains which lay to the west. Lush, flat plains extend to the east and

boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or

docks that provide the town with its revenue. The cry of seabirds is
carried on the sea breeze, the occasional flash of white in the sky
confirms this. The smells and sounds of many horses comes from the east,
where some wooden stables have been built, while to the west is a

onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    The tunnel here is not naturally lit, but a dim blue light emanating
from the east reflects like tiny stars off of the moist walls, although it
is not enough to see in the darkness. The coarse walls meet in a corner to
the southwest, and draw the tunnel on to the north and east.

[36mA Turn in the Tunnel[0;37m
    The tunnel takes an abrupt turn here, leading into darkness both south
and west. A melodic trickling sound echoes through the cavernous walls, its
source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

[36mThe End of a Tunnel[0;37m
    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the
tunnel continues into darkness.

[36mA Musty Cell[0;37m
    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor

    The rocky road through the Khalkist mountain ranges widens and narrows,
rises and falls. Sheer cliff faces of stone to the west, and a deep
crevasse to the south, force a bend in the path. To the north the road
continues to wind through the mountains, while not far to the east lies the
edge of the mountains and the beginning of the Loft foothills.

    A sheer and impassable wall of stone lies directly to the west and

[36mA Path Through the Khalkists[0;37m
    The rocky bend in the mountains is a sort of valley as the taller
mountain peaks all around slope downward. Loose boulders above give an
uneasy feeling, as the mountains funnel to this portion of the road. The
only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs
are unscalable. An indication of civilization comes in the form of a thin
netting that sits along the sloped cliffside to the west, preventing much
of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such
netting to the south.
