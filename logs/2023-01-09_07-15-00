    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    The road continues, snaking through the rocky wilderness. It makes a
large curve to avoid a big boulder, jutting out from the surrounding hills.
You have heard tales of bandits surviving off of travellers on the roadways
of Krynn, and it occurs to you that this would be an excellent spot for an
ambush. The road continues to the north and south.

    Wearily, you come to stop outside a small hovel. It looks like it has
been built as a rest stop to provide a safe haven for travellers. The hovel
sits off to the west of the main road here. The road itself stretches out
to the north and east. The terrain to the east becomes dry and dusty,
while you can see what appears to be a forest on the edge of the plains to
the north.

the air seems to be getting somewhat colder. From a nearby hill, a deer
notices you, and bolts into the woods. From here, the road continues to the

    This part of the road is very steep and treacherous. Rocks are strewn
about on the roadside making the going hard. Looking to the south the road
climbs higher up the mountains and looking to the north the trail heads
down the mountain. In the distant east you can see some forests and far to
the north some foothills.

thin here and you have to gasp for breath. To the south is a high mountain
pass that leads to the to the colder regions of the Kharolis mountains. You
really don't want to go that way but don't have much choice. The mountain
chain here veers off to the northeast and the foothills are visible in the
distant north. You can see some forest in the distant east.

    The air is chilly and the landscape seems almost sick due to the
constant struggle with the cold harsh winds. Trees are stunted and gnarly,
large rocks have left impact marks on the valley floor and have cut paths
of destruction as they hurled down the valley walls. The road picks its
way carefully along, leading to the south entrance of the pass and deeper
into the mountains.

    This is the area known as Southgate, which the dwarves use to describe
the gateway into their mountainous domain. The road to the north leads to a
mountain pass and to the south leads you onto the plains of dust. Looking
west, you can see the ice sheet that caps the Kharolis Range. The pass is
quite narrow and large boulders on the valley floor serve as a reminder of
the dangers of mountain travel.

    You are standing at base of the Kharolis Mountain Range. From this
vantage point, you feel very small indeed. Towering snow-capped peaks
silently thrust into the sky, as if they were literally challenging the Gods
of Krynn for possession of the sky. To your south, the landscape changes to
a dry and cold desert with scoured gullies and rocky crags. To the north
lies a very narrow pass and the only way through these mountains.

    The path ends in a deserted cul-de-sac surrounded by old buildings. The
neighborhood has been deemed old Tarsis by the denizens of the city and is
now home to ruffians and strays. Ivy climbs along the ruined structures and
heaps of stone, masking the dark rock with delicate tendrils of green.
Patches of bramble rose sprout from beneath the rubble, poking through the

    Rows upon rows of bookshelves sprawl out in every direction. A wide
balcony encircles the upper region of the library and the rows of
bookshelves on the floor below. Every square inch of the walls are covered
in bookshelves, upon which lie thousands of ancient tomes. Rival to the
Great Library of Palanthas, this library was once thought to have been lost
in the Cataclysm. There is no telling what secrets and wonders lie within

echoes almost eternally.

    A stark contrast to the nearby rows, the bookshelves here have been
reduced to a large pile of rubble blocking passage in some directions. The

The Aesthetics speak of this section with deep sadness, lamenting the

[36mAn Unadorned Antechamber[0;37m
    This dimly lit and unadorned chamber acts as the entryway to a simple
chapel to the north. The chamber is scarce of anything, save but a few
torches in wall sconces which do not provide enough light. Some dust and
debris has collected in the corners of the room which suggests it is not
regularly looked after. The sturdy stone walls of this chamber are nearly
unmarred except for a few striations slightly visible in the shadows of
torchlight.

    The double doors to the west have been carved from a rather ordinary

from the doors allowing them to be pulled open. Sconces line the walls
throughout this chamber except for along a plain brick wall to the east.

    The fortified walls of Tarsis rise up from the Plains of Dust like
mighty cliffs, defiant against the cold, harsh winds, and dwarfed only by
the fifty foot towers that nearly encircle the city. The ancient city walls
have withstood the tests of time, including the Cataclysm in all of its
fiery glory. Once called Tarsis the Beautiful, the Lordcity was a bustling
sea port, whose rich commerce brought sustainability and prosperity to the
land. The city now looks as desolate as the plains that surround it.
Tempestuous winds assail the walls with endless specks of sand, causing
minimal damage to the walls, but serving as a constant reminder that
nothing can survive forever in these wastelands.

    This, the road to Tarsis, strides boldly through the Plains of Dust,
plunging eastward through the plains and west towards the exotic city of
Tarsis. Glacial winds gust in from the south, hampering your journey. The
plains respond to these forceful winds, born in the heart of Icewall, with
incredible dust storms that constantly threaten to encroach upon Tarsis and
the roads leading to her. Very few plants have the will or tenacity to try
growing on these rocky soils, and the slightest green of a stubborn moss is
a sight for sore eyes.

vegetation, only monotony. Icereach and the Icewall glacier cannot be seen
from this distance, though you can feel their bitter winds. This road winds
its way east to where the dust clouds that billow about the plains

lazily in the air when you speak and breathe, until a strong gust of wind
destroys them. The landscape is barren and rocky, and your feet are numb

howling gusts of wind offer a mere prelude to the dry Plains of Dust which

monotonous. The land is hilly, though not altogether rugged, as most of the
hillsides that comprise the area are grassy or covered with small rocks.
The jagged, violent peaks of the Khalkist Mountains sneer at you high
above to the north.

These hills are the southern extent of the mightly Khalkist Mountains which
loom over you to the north. The peaks are such a bleak, dark grey, they
almost look charred against the sky. To the south the rocky road flattens
somewhat into more hilly foothills while those to the north only become
more treacherous and rocky. In the distance you can see faint signs of
smoke barely rising above the foothills far to the southwest.

[36mTraders Street[0;37m
    The narrow trading street continues to the north, where it leads to the
docks that provide the town with its revenue. The cry of seabirds is
carried on the sea breeze, the occasional flash of white in the sky
confirms this. The smells and sounds of many horses comes from the east,
where some wooden stables have been built, while to the west is a
warehouse.

    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

[36mTraders Street[0;37m
    This narrow road runs north-south through the port. Cobbles have been
hastily laid in the dirt as befits a prosperous town. Narrow but tall
houses and buildings loom above you, cutting out some of the daylight that
shows the street traders in their full colours. Small children play in the
dirt and down small alleys that lead to places of ill-repute. To the north
lies the main trading square, much banter and joyous laughter are carried
on the fresh sea breeze.

[36mThe Tavern Square[0;37m
    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.
