    The trees that line the route give a good indication of the ways to
travel. To the north the huge vallenwood trees of Solace are visible,
clearly marking the southern entrance to the town. The road to the south
becomes wild and rocky as it leads through a wilder section of forest.

been built as a rest stop to provide a safe haven for travellers. The hovel
sits off to the west of the main road here. The road itself stretches out
to the north and east. The terrain to the east becomes dry and dusty,
while you can see what appears to be a forest on the edge of the plains to
the north.

Although there are a few fresh tracks, the arid landscape keeps this trail
from becoming overgrown with vegetation. Upon a glance, you determine that
most of the tracks were made by unshod horses. From this distance you can
barely discern the outlines of the tents of Que-teh tribe to the northeast.

perhaps the reason for choosing this location as the most recent campground
of the Que-teh plainsmen. The Que-teh village is still quite a distance to
the north, while to the south you can still barely make out the road

    As you approach the Que-teh village, you notice the fresh tracks on
this path increase noticeably. Wildlife here is abundant for the plains,
perhaps the reason for choosing this location as the most recent campground
of the Que-teh plainsmen. The Que-teh village is still quite a distance to
the north, while to the south you can still barely make out the road
through the Plains of Abanasinia.

    As you step past the first few tents, Que-teh village takes form.
Numerous tents of varying sizes can be seen in all directions. While on the
surface this village appears to be somewhat permanent, closer inspection
reveals that if desired the Que-teh could easily break camp and move to a
more fertile landscape. To the north lies the exit to Que-teh village,
while to the east and west a circular path winds through the village.

large and carved with intricate runes from top to bottom, portraying the

    The road continues, now heading to the south. The general terrain seems
to be getting drier and dustier, and there are fewer trees. In addition,
the air seems to be getting somewhat colder. From a nearby hill, a deer
notices you, and bolts into the woods. From here, the road continues to the

been built as a rest stop to provide a safe haven for travellers. The hovel
sits off to the west of the main road here. The road itself stretches out
to the north and east. The terrain to the east becomes dry and dusty,
while you can see what appears to be a forest on the edge of the plains to
the north.

are both loud and drunk. Stale ale and bowls of musty broth are served by a
couple of wenches, occasionally having to fend off a few wandering hands. A
small fireplace lies in the north wall providing little light as most of
the corners of the tavern are shrouded in darkness.

Although there are a few fresh tracks, the arid landscape keeps this trail
from becoming overgrown with vegetation. Upon a glance, you determine that
most of the tracks were made by unshod horses. From this distance you can
barely discern the outlines of the tents of Que-teh tribe to the northeast.

major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. There is always someone
wandering around this path, be it the occasional farmer or group of
children playing contentedly. However, the threat of the dragonarmy looms
over the village at all times, and there is an underlying air of constant
alert.

    You are standing in the middle of a dark, cozy tent. Thick, neatly
trimmed furs of numerous beasts serve as carpeting for this quaint little
room. The lighting is provided by small, rustic lanterns hung upon each of
the tent's four main support poles. The central support pole is rather
large and carved with intricate runes from top to bottom, portraying the
hunt of some great, mystical beast. A bedroll rests on the floor of the
southeast corner of the tent, surrounded by books. Stacks of books and
tanned hides with spell components laid out on them occupy the rest of the
room.

    This well-trod path through Que-teh Village allows easy access to the
few larger and more populated tents of the encampment. It also provides the
major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. There is always someone
wandering around this path, be it the occasional farmer or group of
children playing contentedly. However, the threat of the dragonarmy looms
over the village at all times, and there is an underlying air of constant
alert.

trimmed furs of numerous beasts serve as carpeting for this quaint little
room. The lighting is provided by small, rustic lanterns hung upon each of
the tent's four main support poles. The central support pole is rather
large and carved with intricate runes from top to bottom, portraying the
hunt of some great, mystical beast. A bedroll rests on the floor of the
southeast corner of the tent, surrounded by books. Stacks of books and
tanned hides with spell components laid out on them occupy the rest of the
room.

between them. The forest to the south looks much wilder and more dangerous
than the forest that houses Solace. Southern Avenue leads north into

partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and

partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    You are standing in the middle of a dark, cozy tent. Thick, neatly
trimmed furs of numerous beasts serve as carpeting for this quaint little
room. The lighting is provided by small, rustic lanterns hung upon each of
the tent's four main support poles. The central support pole is rather
large and carved with intricate runes from top to bottom, portraying the
hunt of some great, mystical beast. A bedroll rests on the floor of the
southeast corner of the tent, surrounded by books. Stacks of books and
tanned hides with spell components laid out on them occupy the rest of the
room.

Although there are few fresh tracks, the arid landscape keeps this trail
from becoming overgrown with vegetation. Upon a glance, you determine that
most of the tracks were made by unshod horses. A large road can be seen to
the southwest, and the Que-teh village is some distance northeast.

[36mEastern Avenue[0;37m
    The road is cut from among the huge vallenwoods which protect and house
the inhabitants of Solace. The limbs overhead entwine with one another to
provide a canopy of green foliage which filters out the heat of the sun,
while allowing dim light to shine through. One particularly large
vallenwood stands at the edge of the road. Looking up into it, you notice a
rather large temple is nestled among the limbs. A small stairway spirals
down around the trunk and ends at the road, providing an entry to the
temple. The road itself leads east deeper into the forest and west towards
Solace Square.

    This magic shop is an old and dusty place. Shelves and cases line the
walls and fill the room. Scrolls, books, wands, staves, and all sorts of
magical paraphernalia is on display. The shades on the windows let in stray
rays of light which streak through the dust filled air, making slashes
across the dim room. A faint smell of incense fills the air and you hear
chimes tinkling in the distance. A set of spiral staircase carved into the
tree leads down. The center of the tree can be accessed through a door to
the west.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

black obsidian walls, which surround the perimeter of the tower's ground,

delicate gates of the tower lie to the south, while the two spires of black

    The dense forest around you occasionally places obstacles in your path,
you cannot help but trip and fall. Fortunately the soft cushion of dead
leaves offers much help. Weak sounds of the hustle and bustle of town life
can be heard from the north. The road continues to the south, it seems as

    The trees that line the route give a good indication of the ways to
travel. To the north the huge vallenwood trees of Solace are visible,
clearly marking the southern entrance to the town. The road to the south

between them. The forest to the south looks much wilder and more dangerous
than the forest that houses Solace. Southern Avenue leads north into

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

     accomplished magic user of tenth [10] level with a full
     spellbook. We do not permit you to bring outside objects
     into the Test. Any items you wish to store while taking
     the Test may be kept within the VAULT for a nominal fee.
     The vault lies down in a lower part of this Tower.

          "As you endeavor to pass the Test of High Sorcery,
     proceed carefully. Success will depend on your attention
     to detail and your skill as a magic user. Failure will
     result in your death. The Test is not easy. It requires
     you to use both your magic and your wits, for no mage
     will survive long in this world without both. Before you
     begin the Test, there are a few things you should know.

          "Firstly, divining an understanding the nature of
     the objects you encounter will often mean the difference
     between success and failure. The 'detect magic' spell
     will be most invaluable in this regard.

          "Secondly, if you should find yourself stuck in any
     individual Test, you may use the 'HINT' command to ask
     us for a little guidance. If you manage to complete the
     Test without the aid of any hints, you will receive a
     bonus at the end. You may try it here without penalty.

          "Lastly, know that if you choose to abort the Test
     prematurely, you will have to wait a day before trying
     again. Should you die, however, this restriction will
     not prevent you from another attempt at the Test.

          "Once you are prepared to begin the Test you may
     simply proceed up the tower from here. I'm not sure if
     you have what it takes to succeed, but for your sake,
     I hope you do. Good luck."

    A long, luxurious rug stretches across the center of the chamber from
the silver portal on the east to the wooden staircase that zig-zags up the
western wall. Embroidered with images of important events throughout
history, the beautiful rug tells the story of the defining role that mages
have played in shaping Krynn. Next to the staircase is a simple desk and
chair where the Conclave keeps records of each initiate who attempts the
Test. Many initiates must have passed through recently as the desk is piled
high with papers. The papers move around the desk on their own, and a fine
silver pen floats about, making notations here and there.

The astral projections tells you:

      'I shouldn't be here, but I found it unfair the Conclave sent you
   into the astral plane with no help. This is the plane of dreams and
   imagination. It is an endless sea of gray. You can imagine almost
   anything into being. If you need help, just imagine it. If you need a
   weapon, some armor, or even an exit...just imagine them. Unfortunately,
   even if you want to leave, you'll have to take out the astral stalker.
   He's lurking around, probably guarding the portal out of here. Good
   luck, my friend.'

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
