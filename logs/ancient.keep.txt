ANCIENT KEEP
============

BACKGROUND:

Some adventurers have told stories about the Keep of Gargath being merely
the "tip of the iceberg", so to speak.  Contrary to popular belief, the
heart of Gargath's keep lies beyond many secret doors and passageways.  The
inhabitants of this true keep are among the deadliest foes on Krynn, and
their home suits them.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The Ancient Keep is recommended to only the most skilled and most
stouthearted, elite level [28+] adventurers. Beware! The bolder you
challenge the keep, the quicker you shall meet your maker.

LOCATION:

The Keep is located within the most secret passageways of the home of
Gargath.  There is more than one way to enter, but not too many ways to
escape!
