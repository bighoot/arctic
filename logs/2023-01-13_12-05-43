    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the

    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

[36mSouthern Avenue[0;37m
    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    The rocky bend in the mountains is a sort of valley as the taller
mountain peaks all around slope downward. Loose boulders above give an
uneasy feeling, as the mountains funnel to this portion of the road. The
only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs
are unscalable. An indication of civilization comes in the form of a thin
netting that sits along the sloped cliffside to the west, preventing much
of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such
netting to the south.

    The vaulted ceiling of this antechamber is lined with the angry stone
faces of gargoyles, each more grotesquely twisted than the last. The dark
statues appear to be reaching out in vain, reaching out to tear apart any
blasphemers who dare to enter the temple. A dark initiation chamber rests
just beyond an archway at the southern end of the antechamber, while there
appears to be an unholy light radiating through the northern archway. The
whisper of a seductive voice drifts out of the darkness to the west.

    This vast, open courtyard is large enough to hold thousands of people
and is an excellent place for the dark pilgrims to gather an audience for
mass prayers or public executions. The west end of the court is dominated
by a raised platform where such spectacles can be staged in full view of
the citizenry, and a five-headed dragon has been carved on the wall behind
it. This courtyard somehow manages to be both magnificent and terrible at
the same time. Twisted black gates stand guard to the south while a
spacious stone passageway lies to the north. A wide lane begins at the base
of the platform and leads east into the dismal melee of the city.

acts as a link between courtyards to the north and south, and from here it
is obvious that the Emperor's Court to the north is gaudier, but less grand
than the magnificent and terrible Queen's Court that lies to the south.

of the courtyard, and there is enough space for a couple hundred troops to
line up before it. The ostentatious decorations have clearly been designed
to instill visitors with a sense of awe, but everything looks a bit small,
as if the architect was told to exercise moderation and didn't know how. A
pair of cruel black gates stand at the northern end of the courtyard, while
a spacious stone passageway leads off to the south. Beyond the west end of
the courtyard lies a broad lane and the dolorous milieu of the dark city.

Dark Queen -- as the warrior and as the seductress. The massive gates stand
guard beneath a foreboding archway, and a life-like stone sculpture of the
five-headed dragon perches protectively over the gates. The dragon's heads
seem to be moving, but that is probably just a trick of the shadows.

are to be found in this range. Several disused mine shafts litter the area
and are said to be very dangerous.

only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs

netting that sits along the sloped cliffside to the west, preventing much
of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such

    The stone steps end near the bottom of a sturdy ironwood door to the
south. A heavy wooden bar stretches across to both sides of the frame. This

    Flames flicker from torches set in the opposite walls casting eerie
shadows along the length of the corridor. They give little warmth and
barely any light for you to see your way. The air is cold and stale down
here, the mood oppressive as barred dungeon cells stretch down the hall.
The groans and mutterings of prisoners fill your ears. To the east and west
lie two doors.

    The corridor stretches north and south. Heavily barred cells run along

stone, only to find it long ago burnt out. You wonder if it is purposefully
kept dark down here to further depress the prisoners. The groans and foul
curses of the rowdy prisoners fill your ears. It seems only a lucky few

[36mA Musty Cell[0;37m
    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

you descend into the hole, stepping onto a ladder below and into an
underground tunnel.
[36mThe End of a Tunnel[0;37m
    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the
tunnel continues into darkness.

    The tunnel takes an abrupt turn here, leading into darkness both south

source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Open doorways lead north and south from here, and a dark wood paneled
hallway runs straight to the east. Taking up a majority of the western wall
is a gate of light brown stone, set into a smooth archway that stands as
tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though
the safest path is anyone's guess.

hallway you can hardly miss a large gate that stands directly at the end of
it, while the southern hallway stops at a flight of stairs that lead up to
a higher floor. The only thing of interest here appears to be a wooden door

this, what would be ground level in this subterranean building, by a flight
of stairs against the southern wall. Though you can't see into it very well
from here, you can feel the breeze of freshly circulated air from the room
above, a welcome change from the stagnant and stale air of these
underground halls. To the north the hallway you are in, meets up with
another hallway running east-west.

    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A

thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
