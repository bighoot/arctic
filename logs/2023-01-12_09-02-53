    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

    Waves from the Newsea crash onto the shoreline, sending spray of salty
water into the air. Strong gusts from the north whip at your clothes and
kick sand and water droplets into your face. From the eastern horizon to

Directly across the waters to the north you can barely make out a land mass
and a city, it must be Port o'Call. The sand along the shore becomes more
sparse to the south and a road leads away from the shoreline.

[36mThe West Bank[0;37m
    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

    The road here passes through some large fields of grain, a sign that a
large city is nearby. Looking westward, the towers of Vingaard Keep are
visible perched atop a hill with the city's walls nearby. The road
continues north to a junction of roads from other parts of the continent
and a small tollhouse that stands watch over the intersection. To the
south, the road crosses the Vingaard River via a ford in the river.

    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

    Approaching the massive High Clerist Tower, it is obvious that this
fort is enormous. Designed to protect the Vingaard mountains, the tower is
situated to block the westgate pass. Additions to the walls around the
tower have totally blocked off the passage. The main tower and walls seem
to be quite old, built decades ago.

leaning gently on a walking staff. A small owl is perched on his right
shoulder. The monument to the right looks to be a simple block of granite,
but you sense it is more than that. Stepping closer, you see what appear to
be shatter marks in the otherwise pristine stone. Laying atop the granite
block is what appears to be a mold for the blade and hilt of a sword. The
trees and grass here is severely overgrown, making you wonder when the last

     This dirt path is unremarkable in every respect. There are no tracks
of any animals ground into the loose dirt. There are no plants growing
within the confines of the path, though they grow plentifully on either
side. And there is no sign of the path needing grooming of any kind. Oddly,
the path doesn't even need repair after you walk along it, as if it is
impossible to tarnish its unremarkable appearance. To the north you see
what look like two small towers made of granite and crystal, each
positioned on either side of the path.

     You find yourself at a sudden crossroads of sorts along the dirt path.
To the east and west are two small huts, both made from a magenta plant
that obviously dried out years ago. You find it peculiar that you failed to
notice the huts earlier, but then you notice the collection of large rocks,
some crystal, some granite, stacked up on the southern edges of the huts.
You begin to realize that those are the small towers you saw earlier. There
is a pulsing of energy to the north.

     The path comes to a sudden end here, the path to the north occupied by
a large granite and crystal gate. The only direction available to you is
back to the south since the areas to the east and west are blocked by large
boulders. As you examine the boulders closer, you can almost see the
outlines of various arms, legs, heads, and other body parts. Just as you
begin to wonder if your eyes are failing you, you feel an unseen force
tempting you to enter the gate to the north.

     The air here seems somewhat fresher than on the other side of the
Celestial Gate, but it is tinged with the scent of wizardry and warcraft.
It doesn't take long to realize you are atop a cliff, though its edge is
immediately to the north. You cannot see what lies beyond from where you
are, but it looks to drop off suddenly into a small valley. Although you
feel a sense of wariness, you cannot locate the source of your discomfort
until you realize how quiet it is. Pausing momentarily, you realize there
are no signs or sounds of life anywhere nearby. It's as if all the life in
the area has been swept away by some giant hand.

     As you suspected earlier the cliff drops off into a small valley, but
that supposition couldn't have prepared you for what lies within that
valley. Jutting out from beneath the far wall of the valley is the edge of
a building, made from the same stone as the valley walls. You suspect that
it goes much further into the wall, but can't be sure from this distance.
Lying between you and that building is a large field, which looks as though
a war once raged upon it. There are signs of a barricade to your right, a
rock slide to the left, and various pits and traps in between. With sudden
abruptness you realize you are standing on the cliff the young druid
sacrificed his life upon in a final spell to end the Celestial War. Surely
the building hidden under the valley wall must be the Celestial Temple he
was trying to protect.

[36mExit from the Celestial Valley[0;37m
     Almost as your feet touch the floor of the valley, you feel the air
begin to weigh heavily in your lungs. The odor of centuries old magic and
decades old battles hangs around you like an oppressive blanket. The ground
beneath your feet is a lifeless color, everything that once grew here
having been crushed into oblivion under soldiers' feet years earlier. As
you shuffle your feet to get a better look around, the dust you kick up
begins to mix with the death in the air. The valley walls block your exit
to the west, but the field of battle continues to the east and north. There
appears to be a crystal block immediately north.

[36mNear a Large Monument[0;37m
    The crystal block you saw from further away is clearly a monument, but
who originally erected it is a mystery. It appears to be made from solid
red crystal, at least on this side. As you run your hands along the almost
frictionless surface, you discover that the block turns to granite halfway
along each side. Gazing atop the statue, you see the figure of a large
Aurinite knight, his shield and sword resting against on the ground before
him, staring passionless at the valley wall. There looks to be a second
figure standing back-to-back with the Aurinite, but you can't tell from
this side. Nor can you easily go around the statue as it takes up the
entire area immediately to the east.

made by the body is far too big to be a soldier, even one of their massive
sizes. It becomes immediately apparent that some kind of large dragon died
here, at least that is the impression you get from examining the crevasse.
What happened to the body and who killed it are questions you don't have
answers for, but at least you now have a glimpse of the killing power of
the Aurinite and Gargoyle armies.

     Though there are no bodies, bones, or traces of blood here, it is
clear the Celestial War once raged across this area of the valley. Pieces
of equipment, weapons, and armour covered with years of dust and decay
litter the floor. None appear to be in any condition that would make them
valuable, even as souvenirs of the war. Judging from the few tracks you can
still see on the ground and the collection of equipment nearby, the battle
that occurred here obviously spilled over into the areas to the south and
west. You can't help wonder what happened to the victims this equipment
once protected from harm.

     Remarkably this small area of the valley appears to have been spared
the ravages the rest of the valley suffered. There is no debris from
equipment or weapons, no signs of any scuffles, and no bodies within sight.
It immediately seems strange to you that this single area was saved from
the Celestial War, but then you notice the faint marks along the ground.
Upon closer examination, they vaguely resemble the marks a broom with stiff
bristles might leave if it were used to sweep the area. It is with some
hesitation you admit to yourself that somebody deliberately cleaned this
area of the valley, though for what reason you can only guess.

jutted out from the west wall, comes to an end here, allowing you easy
access to the north again. There is no sign what caused the rock slide this
far from the wall, but it feels unnatural even from this distance. Whatever
force buried the Celestial Temple beneath the valley walls probably
inadvertently caused this rock slide as well. Though you can travel to the
north, west, and south from here, the area immediately to your east has
been cut off by a large pit. Glancing down into the pit you see a
collection of pointed spears, but there are no bodies on the spears
indicating it was ever successfully used.

battle field holds the same signs of the war that plagued the rest of the
valley. There are broken swords, rusted out piece of armour, and various
other pieces of equipment badly in need of repairs. But the war remains
seem deliberately sorted into piles of similar items. Weapons have been
sorted from armour and clothing. By the amount of dust that has collected
on the piles, you guess that whoever did this did so shortly after the war
ended and then left them here unattended.

It takes you a moment to realize what it is, and a moment longer for the

this area truly spectacular is the single flower someone has planted in the

single flower, you notice a dull white fence to the north and beyond it

     The rock slide that spilled into the valley obviously started from
this place, but the disaster looks anything but natural. There are clear
signs from this angle of an explosion, apparently from multiple lightning
bolt strikes given the pattern of them. You find that your attention is
drawn away from the rock slide and to the north, though. A large gate made
of white metal stands before you. A sign hangs on the side of the gate, but
it is in a language you do not understand. Looking through the gate and
seeing what's there, you can't help but feel it reads "Cemetery."

     Although the rock slide continues to the south here, your attention is
immediately drawn to one small item in the valley floor. The area has been
completely cleared of all equipment and weapons that might have been left
from the Celestial War, and the ground has been swept clean. What makes
this area truly spectacular is the single flower someone has planted in the
ground. You almost feel as though someone has begun to restore the valley
to the condition it was before the war ravaged it. As you marvel at the
single flower, you notice a dull white fence to the north and beyond it
what appears to be tombstones.

     Taking up the expanse of land immediately to the south and obscuring

It takes you a moment to realize what it is, and a moment longer for the
oppressive dust to settle. This area of the valley has been thoroughly
cleaned of the remains from the Celestial War. There are no signs of broken
equipment or weaponry. The ground even seems to have been well swept to
clear the excess rubble caused from the rock slide.

     The rock slide you saw from the edge of the valley ends here, but it
isn't the mass of stone that captures your attention. This area of the
battle field holds the same signs of the war that plagued the rest of the
valley. There are broken swords, rusted out piece of armour, and various
other pieces of equipment badly in need of repairs. But the war remains
seem deliberately sorted into piles of similar items. Weapons have been
sorted from armour and clothing. By the amount of dust that has collected
on the piles, you guess that whoever did this did so shortly after the war
ended and then left them here unattended.

looks to be symmetrical down both edges, but you can see no traces of an
entrance. There are obvious signs of the Celestial War marring the
otherwise pristine walls of the temple, but no breaks that would indicate a
way in. In a sudden rush of fear, it occurs to you that the entrance might
be locked forever underneath the rock which covers the rest of the temple.

    The Celestial Temple that drew you to this valley lies along the path
here, taking up most of the area to the northeast. Its surface is made from
the same stone that the valley walls are made of, telling you the Fyzians
didn't go far for construction materials. The temple comes to a corner
immediately to the west of you, but you can also step closer by going
north. There are no immediate signs of battle to the south, but you know
the Celestial War once raged there. The exit to the east is cut off my a
deep ditch that you could probably climb down into but certainly couldn't
climb back out of because of the ground's loose nature.

    The Celestial Temple takes up most of the area to the north, from
immediately to the west to directly north. Its surface, although marred by
the war between the Aurinites and Gargoyles, has obviously had limited
repairs done to it. Some areas are of a slightly lighter color, making you
think the stone there is much more recent than the majority of the temple's
dark brown. There are no signs of who took it upon themselves to repair the
temple, but you can't help but feel it was the Fyzians who originally built
it. Perhaps they felt it was time to restore the valley and its temple
after the young druid who befriended them cast his final spell.

[36mNear a Wall of Spears[0;37m
     You can see where the valley wall meets the Celestial Temple to the
north, the temple continuing for an untold length into the wall. From this
distance it almost appears as though the valley wall came alive and tried
to consume the temple, but only succeeded in getting most of it before its
mouth was full. Blocking your path to the east is a large wall of about a
hundred spears, some topped with granite, others will crystal. The spears
have been stuck into the ground at various angles to each other, providing
a line of defense no matter which side you happen to be on. It would also
make an effective impaling point if an enemy were driven into it. As the
path continues to the north, you can see the ground get softer and darker
in color as if from moisture.

     The valley changes climate abruptly here, going from the dust covered
near desert elsewhere to a marshland. The ground beneath your feet has some
give to it from the moisture in it. There are no signs of plants or
wildlife in the area, but you sense that they are more likely to spring up
here than elsewhere in the valley. You inhale deeply, reveling in the scent
of life and moisture instead of death and decay. Since the rest of the
valley resembles more of a wasteland due to the war, you can't help feel
that someone created this marshland in an effort to restore the valley. To
the north the Celestial Temple meets the valley wall, disappearing from
your sight. To the east you see signs of a camp.

[36mWithin a Large Abandoned Camp[0;37m
     Although this was probably a major camp during the war, possible a
headquarters for one of the two armies, it has long since been abandoned
and lost the importance it once held. There is a fire pit here filled with
logs that haven't been lit in years, if not decades. There is some doubt in
your mind that they will ever light again due to the moisture that now
hangs in the air. This area, like the ones to the west and south, is more a
marshland than the desert the valley has become. You wonder absentmindedly
if the camp was once much larger but was destroyed to make way for the
restoration project. The camp continues to the east, and there is a large
tent still erected to the north.

you can't help feel that the camp was once much larger. From the position
of the few remaining logs and the large pit that is half filled by the

either closed voluntarily due to the passage of time, or somebody cast a

     Although the dried and dead land continues to the valley wall here,
there is the smell of something greater in the air. It seems to be
emanating from both the west and the south, but much stronger to the south.
Your faith that something might be truly alive here is almost restored when
you see the indentations in the wall. The are slightly bigger than a head
with a helmet, and that is exactly what you think caused them. There are
approximately a dozen holes here, leading you to believe that either one
person had his head drilled repeatedly into the walls or this just a
convenient place to perform that task on multiple people. Either way the
sight puts a momentary damper on the scent of life in the air.

     Though it may have been crude and chaotic, the barricade at least
managed to protect this area of the valley from suffering the storm called
the Celestial War. The ground here is soft, alive, and covered with a thick
layer of greenest grass. There are no footprints anywhere nearby, making
you wonder how long it has been since anyone walked over this ground. Save
for the clumsily built barricade, this area is almost magical in its simple
beauty. If the rest of the valley once resembled this small patch of land,
there can be little doubt why the young druid and the Fyzians built the
temple here.

stopped using the tent. That could only mean that the restoration project

[36mNear a Wall of Spears[0;37m
     You can see where the valley wall meets the Celestial Temple to the
north, the temple continuing for an untold length into the wall. From this
distance it almost appears as though the valley wall came alive and tried
to consume the temple, but only succeeded in getting most of it before its
mouth was full. Blocking your path to the east is a large wall of about a
hundred spears, some topped with granite, others will crystal. The spears
have been stuck into the ground at various angles to each other, providing
a line of defense no matter which side you happen to be on. It would also
make an effective impaling point if an enemy were driven into it. As the
path continues to the north, you can see the ground get softer and darker
in color as if from moisture.

[36mThe Celestial Valley[0;37m
    The Celestial Temple takes up most of the area to the north, from
immediately to the west to directly north. Its surface, although marred by
the war between the Aurinites and Gargoyles, has obviously had limited
repairs done to it. Some areas are of a slightly lighter color, making you
think the stone there is much more recent than the majority of the temple's
dark brown. There are no signs of who took it upon themselves to repair the
temple, but you can't help but feel it was the Fyzians who originally built
it. Perhaps they felt it was time to restore the valley and its temple
after the young druid who befriended them cast his final spell.

[36mThe Celestial Valley[0;37m
    The Celestial Temple that drew you to this valley lies along the path
here, taking up most of the area to the northeast. Its surface is made from
the same stone that the valley walls are made of, telling you the Fyzians
didn't go far for construction materials. The temple comes to a corner
immediately to the west of you, but you can also step closer by going
north. There are no immediate signs of battle to the south, but you know
the Celestial War once raged there. The exit to the east is cut off my a
deep ditch that you could probably climb down into but certainly couldn't
climb back out of because of the ground's loose nature.

     The Celestial Temple comes to a corner here, proceeding off to the
northeast and northwest and disappearing into the valley walls. The temple
looks to be symmetrical down both edges, but you can see no traces of an
entrance. There are obvious signs of the Celestial War marring the
otherwise pristine walls of the temple, but no breaks that would indicate a
way in. In a sudden rush of fear, it occurs to you that the entrance might
be locked forever underneath the rock which covers the rest of the temple.

     This room, like its three companions, is spartan to the point of
bareness. The walls are plain and undecorated, the floor is covered with a
fine layer of dirt to serve as a carpet of sorts, and there are only two
torches in the room to illuminate it. The wooden furniture looks almost as
though it is about to fall apart, which doesn't really surprise you. As
you turn to leave, you notice a cloud and a small owl chiseled above the
door. There appears to be a small lever built into the south wall.

     Upon entering this area of the Temple, you stop suddenly and feel your
mouth dropping open. Painted in vibrant colors on the walls are what look
like large crystal being, which you assumed to be Aurinites. But they
aren't wielding weapons, they aren't wearing armor, and they aren't drilling
for battle. They appear to be farming, playing music, and building houses,
nothing you would expect from a race with a military reputation. Set off in
the distance you can see three figures, in three different colored robes,
seemingly walking toward the village.

of the temple and the half dozen pews between you and it are made from a
solid white crystal and seems to be hanging in midair. The only true

like large crystal being, which you assumed to be Aurinites. But they
aren't wielding weapons, they aren't wearing armor, and they aren't drilling
for battle. They appear to be farming, playing music, and building houses,
nothing you would expect from a race with a military reputation. Set off in

different colored robes. They appear to be instructing the Aurinite, though

crystal being, which you assumed to be the Aurinites. But not all the
figures are the same. Some are very young, some are smaller and thinner,
and some are the large knights you know of. As you scan the walls, you
can't help but notice how awkward the Aurinites looks with the weapons and
armor they are wielding, almost as if they are just learning how to use
them. It occurs to you to look down and you see three women, one in a grey

     This room is almost unnerving in its appearance. The walls are made
from a transparent crystal, though you can't see outside the Temple or into
another room as you might expect. Instead all you see is the clear crystal,
making you feel as though you are floating in air. The altar at the far end
of the temple and the half dozen pews between you and it are made from a
solid white crystal and seems to be hanging in midair. The only true
decoration is the figure of a white owl placed in the center of the altar.

     Chiseled into the walls and ceiling here are what look like large
crystal being, which you assumed to be the Aurinites. But not all the
figures are the same. Some are very young, some are smaller and thinner,
and some are the large knights you know of. As you scan the walls, you
can't help but notice how awkward the Aurinites looks with the weapons and
armor they are wielding, almost as if they are just learning how to use
them. It occurs to you to look down and you see three women, one in a grey

Somehow you think they are teaching the Aurinites how to fight.

     Upon entering this area of the Temple, you stop suddenly and feel your
mouth dropping open. Painted in vibrant colors on the walls are what look
like large crystal being, which you assumed to be Aurinites. But they
aren't wielding weapons, they aren't wearing armor, and they aren't drilling
for battle. They appear to be farming, playing music, and building houses,
nothing you would expect from a race with a military reputation. Set off in
the distance you can see three figures, in three different colored robes,
seemingly walking toward the village.

     The decorations here aren't so much carvings as they are paintings of
gold and silver. Obviously this room illustrates the final days of the
Celestial War before the druid trapped them within the Temple walls.
Standing at the top of the wall wrapped in strands of silver energy is the
druid caught in his final spell. Below him are the two armies, each
surrounded by swirls of gold and silver. At the bottom of the wall is the
Celestial Valley slowly recovering from the war that raged across it.

     Carved into the white marble walls here is a piece of the history of
the Celestial Temple. As you run your fingers along the wall you trace what
looks like the arrival of the two armies to the Temple. Near the top are
the two kings engaged in battle. Below them are the two armies engaged in
the deadliest of combat. There looks to have been something below that, but
it has since been lost to the sands of time.

guardian of the temple is obviously assigned to the moon temple. He is
wrapped in a sky blue robe. Running through the robe in various places
are patches of white, much like clouds. Besides his overly muscular
frame and tanned skin, he looks much like any other human guard you've

     Carved into the white marble walls here is a piece of the history of
the Celestial Temple. As you run your fingers along the wall you trace what
looks like the arrival of the two armies to the Temple. Near the top are
the two kings engaged in battle. Below them are the two armies engaged in
the deadliest of combat. There looks to have been something below that, but
it has since been lost to the sands of time.

     The carvings here seem to be more scrawlings that anything else,
almost as if a child had done them. High on the wall, higher than any child
could reach, is the barren Celestial Valley before the Temple was built on
it. Below that is a race of dwarf-like creatures carrying equipment into
the valley. Near the bottom is the half finished Temple. It occurs to you
that the large Temple drawn here is considerably larger than what you can

     The first thing you notice is the large tracks in the white dust below
your feet. Whereas the rest of the dust in the temple seems to settle as
soon as people pass through it, the dust here has obviously been disturbed
too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high
traffic area, though there is no way to tell why from here. There is a
large granite door to the east, one of only a few in the Temple.

     Set into the west wall here is a flickering torch made from an almost
black wood. But that isn't what draws your attention, especially since the
remainder of this room is basically spartan. Hanging in the air foot above
your head are three arrows, one pointing towards each of the three exits.
The east arrow has the word "Legends" written on it. The north arrow has
the word "Land." The south arrow has the word "Portal." Obviously this is
an important crossroad in the Temple.

[36mA Celestial Gate[0;37m
     Before you stands a Celestial Gate, though this one is considerably
smaller than the ones you saw in the valley earlier. It is also carved
directly into the east wall instead of standing alone. The room is heavily
decorated with images of gargoyles and Aurinites, though none of them are
armed with weaponry. The more you study the carvings, the more it looks
like the two races are living peacefully. You suspect these were chiseled
centuries ago, well before the Celestial War began.

There are no signs telling you what is in each direction, but you
immediately pick up some signs. The dust on the floor to the east seems to
be well passed on. To the south you can see the flicker of a torch set in

your feet. Whereas the rest of the dust in the temple seems to settle as
soon as people pass through it, the dust here has obviously been disturbed
too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high
traffic area, though there is no way to tell why from here. There is a

     You find yourself at a crossroads in an otherwise nondescript room.
There are no signs telling you what is in each direction, but you
immediately pick up some signs. The dust on the floor to the east seems to
be well passed on. To the south you can see the flicker of a torch set in
the wall. The passage to the west looks like more of the same undecorated
stone as you are currently surrounded by. To the north there is what
appears to be a tree.

     The first thing you notice, and most magnificent item in this room, is
a large oak tree taking up the entire north wall. There is no sign of how
sunlight and water get to the tree, yet it still stands before you
majestically. To the right and left of the tree are two small shrines, both
covered with magenta clothes. The floor beneath your feet is completely
bare of the white dust you've seen everywhere else in the Temple. To the
east you feel a holy presence, as if from a chapel.

     Drab in color and ordinary in appearance, this temple is almost
barren. The walls, floor, and ceiling are a dark brown in color with veins
of green streaming through them. The altar at the far end of the room is
made from a dirty grey stone, its surface covered with specks of black and
brown. Filling the area between you and the altar are a half dozen pews,
each made from what looks like solidified mud. The only decoration in the
room is a mosaic of a white wolf on the wall behind the altar.

     The darkness here is unsettling to say the least. You can almost feel
it soaking into your soul and trying to possess everything that you are. In
the flicker of your light you can see nothing but black walls. There are no
decorations, no carvings, nothing to break the disheartening blackness of
this room. The abyss-like darkness continues unabated to the west but stops
immediately to the south as though it can't progress in that direction.

     The first thing you notice, and most magnificent item in this room, is
a large oak tree taking up the entire north wall. There is no sign of how
sunlight and water get to the tree, yet it still stands before you
majestically. To the right and left of the tree are two small shrines, both
covered with magenta clothes. The floor beneath your feet is completely
bare of the white dust you've seen everywhere else in the Temple. To the
east you feel a holy presence, as if from a chapel.

it soaking into your soul and trying to possess everything that you are. In
the flicker of your light you can see nothing but black walls. There are no
decorations, no carvings, nothing to break the disheartening blackness of
this room. The abyss-like darkness continues unabated to the west but stops
immediately to the south as though it can't progress in that direction.

     Two forces seem to collide here. To the east you see nothing but
darkness and black marble walls. To the north is a light from a flickering
torch and nearly transparent crystal walls. The north is also considerably
warmer than the east. The two powers seem to meet in the middle of the room
and cancel each other out in a nearly straight line. Halfway up the wall,
split by the powers of light and dark, is the figure of an owl holding a
sacred sword.

transparent crystal, though you can't see through it into any other rooms.
The walls are bare of any decorations save a single symbol below the torch.

two forces.  In the center of the room is a small sword, probably meant to
represent Caliburn, the sword of sacred fires.

     Set prominently in the north wall is a large torch, its surface alight
with an almost living fire. It dances and swings wordlessly in a breeze
only it can feel. The walls of this junction are made from an almost
transparent crystal, though you can't see through it into any other rooms.
The walls are bare of any decorations save a single symbol below the torch.
Although you cannot tell what language it is, a voice seems to whisper in
the back of your head the phrase 'Holy Light.'

     You find yourself at a junction in the corridor. To the north you hear
what sounds like metal being scrapped heavily against stone. It's
impossible to tell how far to the north it is due to the echoes in the
hallway. To the south you can just make out a large chamber in the
distance. To the east you can see the flicker of a torchlight and hear the
laughing of children, an odd sound in the otherwise solemn Temple.

     The walls of the Temple are made from solid white marble here, a
remarkable contrast to the drab brown stone that makes up the exterior of
the temple. The floor is layered with a thin white dust, which you suspect
is the same marble of the walls. On the east wall is the figure of an
Aurinite holding a basket of herbs. On the west wall is a gargoyle, its
claws clutching a small child. It occurs to you for the first time that
every member of each race is necessarily warlike.

     The white marble walls of this room are intricately covered with runes
and carvings displaying everything from the construction of the temple to
the coming of the Celestial War. It is almost as if this room serves as the
visual history of the temple. You notice that there is very little space
for any additional events to be chiseled, meaning either the prophets
expect little else to happen or the temple is nearing the end of its
existence. If it is the latter, you can't help but feel that a great
chapter in the realm is coming to a close.

happened here recently to change that. Sections of the walls are covered
with a light red, almost as if blood was splashed on the wall and then
partially washed off. Whatever happened to cause this, it happened

soon as people pass through it, the dust here has obviously been disturbed
too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high

they have continued to run the Temple without ever knowing of the Celestial

with hunger for battle. To one side is a Gargoyle larger than the rest,

past. These creatures actually look like they are at peace. In various
images from the walls you realize that these Gargoyles lived in a village
somewhere in a forest. They seem to be hunting and even farming, but you
can see no traces of weapons or armor. In the distance you see three

[36mA Celestial Gate[0;37m
     Before you stands a Celestial Gate, though this one is considerably
smaller than the ones you saw in the valley earlier. It is also carved
directly into the west wall instead of standing alone. Strangely this gate
is in the corridor instead of in a room by itself like the other gates in
the Temple. There is a fine carpet of white dust on the floor, though what
it is composed of you can only guess. Set in the south wall is a single
torch, its light flickering uncertainly. There are no carvings or other
decorations in the room.

     This chamber is elaborately decorated with images of light, water, and
life. The walls are covered with various kinds of crystal, adding to the
enlightening and encouraging effect of the area. There are scenes for
Aurinites and Gargoyles being led toward a brighter future, their weapons
and war long since forgotten. There is no source of who is teaching them
the new ways, and you can't tell if this is a scene from an ancient past or
a prophecy of things to come.

anywhere in sight, although you sense that something dark and evil is to
the south.

life. The walls are covered with various kinds of crystal, adding to the
enlightening and encouraging effect of the area. There are scenes for
Aurinites and Gargoyles being led toward a brighter future, their weapons
and war long since forgotten. There is no source of who is teaching them
the new ways, and you can't tell if this is a scene from an ancient past or
a prophecy of things to come.

     Before you stands a Celestial Gate, though this one is considerably
smaller than the ones you saw in the valley earlier. It is also carved
directly into the west wall instead of standing alone. Strangely this gate
is in the corridor instead of in a room by itself like the other gates in
the Temple. There is a fine carpet of white dust on the floor, though what
it is composed of you can only guess. Set in the south wall is a single
torch, its light flickering uncertainly. There are no carvings or other

     The first thing that draws your attention is the black marble walls, a
stark contrast to the usually tan walls of the rest of the Temple. The
monotony of the walls is occasionally broken by small pinpricks of light,
which can only be magic in origin. At the far end of the room is an almost
completely black altar, its surface nearly flawless. The area between you
and the altar is filled with half a dozen pews, each made from a grey
stone. It occurs to you that you are meant to feel as though you are
standing in the night sky.

soon as people pass through it, the dust here has obviously been disturbed
too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high

     Your attention is immediately drawn to the north where you hear a low
chanting. As you glance in that direction, you see the white marble walls
of the chamber change into yellow crystal. The chamber to the north also
seems to be brighter than the one you are in, almost as if it has a light
source that doesn't reach outside of the room. Otherwise there is nothing
remarkable about the room you are in, save the white dust on the floor.

shining. The floor is covered with the same white dust you've seen
elsewhere in the Temple. There are no decorations, adornments, or carvings

the south.

happened here recently to change that. Sections of the walls are covered
with a light red, almost as if blood was splashed on the wall and then
partially washed off. Whatever happened to cause this, it happened
recently. On a whim you glance upward and notice that the source of the

too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high

penetrate the total blackness that sits there like a waiting demon.

your head are three arrows, one pointing towards each of the three exits.

     The walls here are lined with an uncountable number of pots and vases,
all of them without decoration. The pots are stacked, reaching up to the
ceiling. Only a handful of the pots aren't covered, and those that are are
probably locked up tight with magic or other means. Inside the open pots
you can see old, tattered scrolls. There are no pieces of furniture or
decorations in the room, making you think this is simply a storage room.

[36mAt a Flickering Torch[0;37m
     Set into the west wall here is a flickering torch made from an almost
black wood. But that isn't what draws your attention, especially since the
remainder of this room is basically spartan. Hanging in the air foot above
your head are three arrows, one pointing towards each of the three exits.
The east arrow has the word "Legends" written on it. The north arrow has
the word "Land." The south arrow has the word "Portal." Obviously this is
an important crossroad in the Temple.

     Before you can even look around the room, you feel a shiver run
through your system. It doesn't take long to realize it is the area to the
north that is causing your discomfort. Despite your best efforts, you can't
penetrate the total blackness that sits there like a waiting demon.
Suppressing another shiver, you look around the room. This section of the
Temple is completely nondescript, almost as if people were too scared to
spend much time here.

     An odd silence overtakes the Temple here. There are no sounds of
movement, no scrapings of metal, and no voices in the distance. It's almost
as though this room is immune to the affairs of the Temple and the war
raging on the floors above. The walls here are also completely plain, the
dust on the floor undisturbed by time or even your footsteps. For some
reason, this room has remained completely pristine.

     The white marble walls of this room are intricately covered with runes
and carvings displaying everything from the construction of the temple to
the coming of the Celestial War. It is almost as if this room serves as the
visual history of the temple. You notice that there is very little space
for any additional events to be chiseled, meaning either the prophets
expect little else to happen or the temple is nearing the end of its
existence. If it is the latter, you can't help but feel that a great

impossible to tell how far to the north it is due to the echoes in the

     The white marble walls of this room are intricately covered with runes
and carvings displaying everything from the construction of the temple to
the coming of the Celestial War. It is almost as if this room serves as the
visual history of the temple. You notice that there is very little space
for any additional events to be chiseled, meaning either the prophets
expect little else to happen or the temple is nearing the end of its
existence. If it is the latter, you can't help but feel that a great
chapter in the realm is coming to a close.

     Your attention is immediately drawn to the north where you hear a low
chanting. As you glance in that direction, you see the white marble walls
of the chamber change into yellow crystal. The chamber to the north also
seems to be brighter than the one you are in, almost as if it has a light
source that doesn't reach outside of the room. Otherwise there is nothing
remarkable about the room you are in, save the white dust on the floor.

     There is little to set this room apart from the remainder of the
Temple. The walls are an undistinguished white marble and cleaned to almost
shining. The floor is covered with the same white dust you've seen
elsewhere in the Temple. There are no decorations, adornments, or carvings
anywhere in sight, although you sense that something dark and evil is to
the south.

[36mThe Celestial Temple[0;37m
     Although you suspect that this chamber was meant to be the same
pristine white marble as the rest of the Temple, something must have
happened here recently to change that. Sections of the walls are covered
with a light red, almost as if blood was splashed on the wall and then
partially washed off. Whatever happened to cause this, it happened
recently. On a whim you glance upward and notice that the source of the
stain seems to be the floor above, almost as if the blood seeped through
the floor.

     The first thing you notice is the large tracks in the white dust below
your feet. Whereas the rest of the dust in the temple seems to settle as
soon as people pass through it, the dust here has obviously been disturbed
too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high
traffic area, though there is no way to tell why from here. There is a
large yellow crystal door to the west, one of only a few in the Temple.
