    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

to the west. The sandy beach leads eastwards and comes to a trailhead,
leading through some verdant rolling hills. The sky is partially cloudy,
and a drizzle of rain can be felt from time to time.

staining the sand with moisture. Far to the southeast, beyond the hills,
the terrain opens up into a vast desert known as the Plains of Dust. There

great distance towards the west, and rise up like towering giants. Beyond
that, though not visible, lies the waters of New Sea. Ogre Peaks and Onyx
Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name
suggests, is home to many ogres. The land to the north is a mighty plain
known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.

to the hustle and bustle of a live forest provides you with enough energy
to keep your feet light on the path. To the east, the trail continues on

    Several climates converge on the groves of trees loosely dotting the
grassy landscape here, and signs of wildlife can be seen all throughout
the area. The lush forests to the south evoke a sense of peacefulness.
Mountains line the horizon to the north and rolling deserts far to the
east, while thick tree cover to the south denotes the legendary forests of
Silvanesti. An unkempt trail lingers from moderate traffic to the east and
west.

The land here suffers badly from the unrelenting winds that blow across the
desert to the west. Lizards take shelter in the shadows of the rocks where
the sand is not hot enough to roast them, but there is no shade large
enough for larger animals. Each step sinks into the searing sand, the air
thick and hazy, each breath like drowning in lava.

    The beating sun bakes the dirt road in such heat that the road has
cracked into what almost resembles cobblestones. Insects scurry across,
careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only
option is to continue either north or south.

cannery offices. The unfortunate wearily trudge south in search of a warm
fire and a pint. Travellers heading to and from the north think of long

onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Flames flicker from torches set in the opposite walls casting eerie

barely any light for you to see your way. The air is cold and stale down
here, the mood oppressive as barred dungeon cells stretch down the hall.
The groans and mutterings of prisoners fill your ears. To the east and west

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Standing before double doors carved with the two common visages of
Takhisis, you are immediately struck by a powerful evil aura. Stone walls
meet up with a curved ceiling, and lead westward through a twisting
passage, while to the east the foreboding doors of a temple to the dark
goddess lie before you. Clearly the coward's way is to flee west away from
the danger within, though those who wish to follow in the footsteps of
heroes would surely brave on to the dangers of the temple.

sacrificial altar made of pure silver. Two arms ending in sharp claws
branch out from it's base to hold the sacrifice, and a sharp blade
protrudes in between their grip to thrust through the victim's chest. At
the base of the altar a bowl rests in the gaping maw of a dragon's head
crafted of the same silver, full of blood from the latest human sacrifice
to the goddess Takhisis.

branch out from it's base to hold the sacrifice, and a sharp blade
protrudes in between their grip to thrust through the victim's chest. At
the base of the altar a bowl rests in the gaping maw of a dragon's head
crafted of the same silver, full of blood from the latest human sacrifice
to the goddess Takhisis.

You approach the scout in an attempt to release him from the altar, but he
cries out in agony at the slightest touch. Gasping for breath and bleeding
profusely, he manages to keep from slipping into unconciousness long enough
to speak his last words. "I came here... with two more... free them from the
dungeon... check folds of my shirt f..." With those words the scout's eyes
lose their focus and his head drops silently to his chest. Reaching into his
shirt you come across an emblem torn from solamnic armor, it must have been
important to him to have been the only possession that he kept secretly.

of a dragon with five heads, standing upon a dais. Pews run across the room
parallel to the altar of Takhisis, supplying clerics of the evil goddess

beautiful woman and the other a hideous dragon with five heads.

meet up with a curved ceiling, and lead westward through a twisting
passage, while to the east the foreboding doors of a temple to the dark

the danger within, though those who wish to follow in the footsteps of

luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty

    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the
tunnel continues into darkness.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

    The ruins of Elial rest here, endlessly battered and broken down by the
Plains of Dust. Elial was once the sister city of Purstal, but now both lie
crumbled and forgotten. A few small structures still remain intact, but
neglect will soon force them to collapse upon themselves. These ruins, much
like the others found in this wasteland, act as waypoints throughout the
region. Travelers might seek shelter in the ruins as they cross the plains,
which inadvertently attracts bandits and thieves. The ruins themselves can
be entered, but there is no indication of what lies hidden within.

    The road here leads west, further into the ruins of Elial. Once
spanning to other great trade cities such as Purstal, Qindaras, and
Wallach, the road is now buried beneath the sands and snow of the Plains of
Dust. The ruined city groans softly in the breeze, as many of the
surrounding structures have already crumbled in the distant past. Still,
the ruins may well make for good shelter from the harsh environment
beyond. Booted footprints can be seen in the rubble leading through the
streets to the west as somebody seems to have already set up camp.

    The road here leads west, further into the ruins of Elial. Once
spanning to other great trade cities such as Purstal, Qindaras, and
Wallach, the road is now buried beneath the sands and snow of the Plains of
Dust. The ruined city groans softly in the breeze, as many of the
surrounding structures have already crumbled in the distant past. Still,
the ruins may well make for good shelter from the harsh environment
beyond. Booted footprints can be seen in the rubble leading through the
streets to the west as somebody seems to have already set up camp.

Smaller buildings of rotten wood creak as the winds press on them and
threaten to topple them over. Despite the disarray, small tables and
campfires litter the roads as though somebody has established themselves
here. Several buildings remain to the north but much of the debris has
cordoned off several areas of the once bustling trade city.

    Heaps of timber and stone have formed large piles of rubble all

shelter from the winds and none from the sun when it is highest in the sky.
Smaller buildings of rotten wood creak as the winds press on them and
threaten to topple them over. Despite the disarray, small tables and
campfires litter the roads as though somebody has established themselves
here. Several buildings remain to the north but much of the debris has
cordoned off several areas of the once bustling trade city.

    The rundown tavern has been abandoned for a long time, serving as just
another structure to provide a minimalistic shelter from the weather. The
remaining stores have long since been pilfered, and broken glass and bar
stools have cluttered the floors for ages. A random assortment of new
chairs and tables have been brought in, however, as the tavern seems to
have been reopened by its new occupants. Recently spilled ale covers the
wood floor, making it sticky to walk on. The scent of body odor lingers
heavy in the air as if many unwashed persons were just here.

[36mA Ramshackle Tavern[0;37m
    The rundown tavern has been abandoned for a long time, serving as just
another structure to provide a minimalistic shelter from the weather. The
remaining stores have long since been pilfered, and broken glass and bar
stools have cluttered the floors for ages. A random assortment of new
chairs and tables have been brought in, however, as the tavern seems to
have been reopened by its new occupants. Recently spilled ale covers the
wood floor, making it sticky to walk on. The scent of body odor lingers
heavy in the air as if many unwashed persons were just here.

    Heaps of timber and stone have formed large piles of rubble all
throughout the ruins of Elial. Crumbling stone structures offer a scant
shelter from the winds and none from the sun when it is highest in the sky.
Smaller buildings of rotten wood creak as the winds press on them and
threaten to topple them over. Despite the disarray, small tables and
campfires litter the roads as though somebody has established themselves
here. Several buildings remain to the north but much of the debris has
cordoned off several areas of the once bustling trade city.

great distance towards the west, and rise up like towering giants. Beyond
that, though not visible, lies the waters of New Sea. Ogre Peaks and Onyx
Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name
suggests, is home to many ogres. The land to the north is a mighty plain
known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.
Skirting the northern tip of the Silvanesti forest, the road continues east
into the lands of Khur.

seagulls and the thick, saline smell of saltwater. It is well traveled by
merchants and sailors, as well as the occasional band of thieves.

    This road follows the coast of the Khurman Sea. A glittering expanse of
blue water lies west of the road. The saline smell of saltwater hangs
thinly in the air, quickly dispelled by the frequent warm winds rolling
down from the Khuri-Khan and Ek-Khan far east of here. The cool breeze from
the sea meets the winds of the hills here in a mild, gusty breeze that
sways the few trees that manage to grow along this road. To the north you

few trees that brave the heat of the relentless summer suns, and several
travelers rest in the shade of these large hardwoods. You can see the
sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south, and the smell of the sea is
strong in the air, the glittering, placid waters of the Bay of Balifor
being visible to the west.  Curving north and to the west, the dusty
road continues along the rolling plains.

    The room is neat and orderly, more spacious than the other rooms on

looking papers. Behind that is a cushy chair and smaller wooden chairs
arranged in front. Off to the west lies a small cot that doesn't appear to
have been slept in much.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the

source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Narrow isles lead in between the wooden pews from north to south,
heading up to the base of an altar dedicated to Takhisis, which takes up
the entire southern wall of this wide room. Light tan pallets of woven hemp
line the rows of pews from east to west, upon which Takhisis's acolytes
kneel to offer her dark prayers. Leading west is an entryway into a
hallway, occupied by two black wooden doors, one bearing a carving of a
beautiful woman and the other a hideous dragon with five heads.

    Looming at ceiling's height at the southern wall is a lifelike statue
of a dragon with five heads, standing upon a dais. Pews run across the room
parallel to the altar of Takhisis, supplying clerics of the evil goddess
with a place to worship. In between pews, hemp pallets stretch the length
of the room for devotees to kneel in the presence of their deity.

[36mA Sacrificial Chamber[0;37m
    The stone walls here are obscured by black curtains that hang loosely
from the ceiling. Rising up from the floor near the south wall is a
sacrificial altar made of pure silver. Two arms ending in sharp claws
branch out from it's base to hold the sacrifice, and a sharp blade
protrudes in between their grip to thrust through the victim's chest. At
the base of the altar a bowl rests in the gaping maw of a dragon's head
crafted of the same silver, full of blood from the latest human sacrifice
to the goddess Takhisis.

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on

onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and

[36mIntersecting Halls[0;37m
    Dark wooden panels make up the walls of the two hallways that converge
here, and dirt trails the floor following them both. Down the western
hallway you can hardly miss a large gate that stands directly at the end of
it, while the southern hallway stops at a flight of stairs that lead up to
a higher floor. The only thing of interest here appears to be a wooden door
leading east.

    Oaken panels stained dark line the sides of the hall, and also end it
in a solid wall to the south. From here you can access the floor above
this, what would be ground level in this subterranean building, by a flight
of stairs against the southern wall. Though you can't see into it very well
from here, you can feel the breeze of freshly circulated air from the room
above, a welcome change from the stagnant and stale air of these
underground halls. To the north the hallway you are in, meets up with
another hallway running east-west.

    You stand at the base of a large hill. As you scan the area, you only
notice the grassy hills surrounding you which block your sight of anything
beyond the hills. The path leads up the hill or cuts between the hills
towards the south.

around, you notice the large hills surrounding you, and a forest rising a
ways off to your east. The path leads to the east across the hill tops or

    The path continues to run across the tops of the Estwilde hills.
Surveying the area you notice some ranches nearby just off the path. The
ranch off to your southeast catches your attention, oddly the fields around
it have dried up, despite the lush, green surrounding region. The path
continues to the east and west across the hill tops.

    The path you are on winds its way across the linked hill tops of the
Estwilde hills. A small, dusty path heads off to the south towards a farm.
The fields surrounding the farm have dried up, very odd when considering
the lush hills of the region. You sense there may be some magic at work
there. The main path continues on to the east and west through the hills.

waste their time and energy needlessly. The path winds its way to the
north, avoiding several large hills to the east. To your west the path

to be getting smaller to your north, perhaps the hills are finally coming
to an end in that direction. Towards your south the path bends around a
large hill which blocks the path's course.

towering hills which block your sight beyond them. The path splits to the

pause and listen, you hear many strange sounds, most of which are unknown
to you. The forest you are about to enter off to your northeast stirs your

heads towards the dense forest to your east, or returns to the light
woodlands up the small hill above you.

light to reach the forest floor, which has killed all the undergrowth
leaving a barren ground. The forest seems to reach around you but the thick

THE CAMP SKILL
Format: CAMP

The land of Krynn is vast, and many travelers spend days on end without
seeing any signs of civilization. The ability to find comfort in the
wilderness is required for adventurers seeking glory, since one cannot
always count on finding an inn or tavern to rest and recuperate. Building a
camp can provide adventurers with a "home away from home" and, while only a
temporary solution, it is often enough to get a party ready to brave another
day fighting dragons, warlords or mighty feral cats. Proficient campers
often provide an extra touch that makes their camps all the more
comfortable and refreshing.

To train this skill, make camps as often as possible.

Details:
- See above.

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.
