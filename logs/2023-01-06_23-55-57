    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    Waves from the Newsea crash onto the shoreline, sending spray of salty

kick sand and water droplets into your face. From the eastern horizon to

Directly across the waters to the north you can barely make out a land mass
and a city, it must be Port o'Call. The sand along the shore becomes more
sparse to the south and a road leads away from the shoreline.

world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

large city is nearby. Looking westward, the towers of Vingaard Keep are
visible perched atop a hill with the city's walls nearby. The road
continues north to a junction of roads from other parts of the continent
and a small tollhouse that stands watch over the intersection. To the
south, the road crosses the Vingaard River via a ford in the river.

    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

    To the east farms spread out across the fields. The air here smells
heavily of manure. Along the eastern side of the trail a wooden fence has
been set up to protect the fields, while to the west a thick forest,
strangely lush and thick in an area where fields are more common. The wide
path cuts north, further into the widening fields, and south towards a
large city.

manure. Around you grass is blown in the wind, growing thicker as it leads
into a lush forest to the west.

    Just beyond the western gates of Kalaman, the trail splits into two
paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off to
the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.

    Although structurally well built, this entrance hall lacks any finesse
or fashion. The walls are completely bare stone, there is no furniture
within eyeshot and the floor has been made of plain oaken floorboards. The
White Dragonarmy's leadership is obviously more concerned with devoting
their resources to their war effort rather than luxury. Corridors to the
north and east lead to other areas of the officers' mess, whilst a pair of
thick ironwood doors are fixed in the western wall.

through the air when it is kicked up by dragonarmy recruits honing their
combat skills. Wooden training dummies crafted to resemble humanoid figures
are scattered through the area, covered with large notches and gouges where
weapons have bit deep into their timber. Marring the dust covered ground
are some splashes of crimson, most likely dried blood that was spilt during
heated sparring sessions. The camp's main gate lies directly to the south,

    Grey dirt has been heavily compacted here to form a sandy path that
leads from the dusty training grounds where the recruits hone their battle
skills to a large stone building directly north of here. Tall banners of
pitch black cloth hang over the walls of the building emblazoned with the
snow white insignia of the White Dragonarmy. The stone building is well
constructed and made from thick stone, having been clearly designed as a
well fortified structure that can be used as a defensive position should
the training camp come under siege. Clouds of dust are occasionally blown
through the area, carried in from the dusty training grounds to the east by
gusts of wind that ebb and flow.

skills to a large stone building directly north of here. Tall banners of
pitch black cloth hang over the walls of the building emblazoned with the

constructed and made from thick stone, having been clearly designed as a

the training camp come under siege. Clouds of dust are occasionally blown

[36mThe Captain's Quarters[0;37m
    The furnishings of this room are lavish by comparison to the rest of
the officer's mess, though saying the room is luxurious would be far from
the truth. Large maps of Solamnia, Palanthas and Vingaard are spread across
the stone walls of the chamber which have numerous small pins placed in
them, presumably marking specific strategic locations. Set up in the
western half of the room is a massive desk of solid ironwood complete with
a wooden chair where the leader of this camp presumably completes any
administrative work that is required, though the build up of paperwork
suggest those duties are often neglected. Two small green potted plants
rest in the corners of the room which provide some colour and vibrancy to
the room, breathing a wisp of life into the otherwise dull environment.

    Although structurally well built, this entrance hall lacks any finesse
or fashion. The walls are completely bare stone, there is no furniture
within eyeshot and the floor has been made of plain oaken floorboards. The
White Dragonarmy's leadership is obviously more concerned with devoting
their resources to their war effort rather than luxury. Corridors to the
north and east lead to other areas of the officers' mess, whilst a pair of
thick ironwood doors are fixed in the western wall.

[36mBefore a Large Building[0;37m
    Grey dirt has been heavily compacted here to form a sandy path that
leads from the dusty training grounds where the recruits hone their battle
skills to a large stone building directly north of here. Tall banners of
pitch black cloth hang over the walls of the building emblazoned with the
snow white insignia of the White Dragonarmy. The stone building is well
constructed and made from thick stone, having been clearly designed as a
well fortified structure that can be used as a defensive position should
the training camp come under siege. Clouds of dust are occasionally blown
through the area, carried in from the dusty training grounds to the east by
gusts of wind that ebb and flow.

humanoid figure are scattered through the area, covered with large notches
and gouges where metal weapons have bit deep into their timber. Marring the
dust covered ground are a few splashes of crimson, most likely dried blood
that was spilt during heated sparring sessions. The dusty training grounds

series of makeshift dart boards have been hung along the northern wall
which are riddled with plain iron darts, probably constructed by the camp's
resident blacksmith. Tables and chairs take up most of the space in the
room to allow the recruits to sit while they eat, though many of the chairs
seem to have been partially broken. Thick aromas of roasted meat waft in
from the kitchen to the south of the barracks, while the the quarters
connected to the west seems to be slightly quieter.

    This small stone building has been converted into a dragon hatchery
where the White Dragonarmy births and raises the next generation of
fearsome white dragons that will reign death upon their enemies. The floor
of the building is layered with filthy brown mud that is interwoven with
small pellets of dragon feces and is in desperate need of cleaning, though
it would take a small army working for numerous days to reverse the
hygenial neglect this building has gone through in recent times.

in this dragon pen. It is riddled with small pieces of dragon feces and
creamy fragments of broken eggshells, having been shattered under foot and
mixed into the filth. There are still a few intact dragon eggs lying on the
far wall of the pen, though whether or not the baby dragons inside them
will ever hatch is a mystery. The air in this pen is thick and moist,
making it a perfect carrier for the utterly rancid stench that is emanating
from the brown slime that coats the area. It seems unimaginable that any
creature could actually live in these conditions.

    Disgusting, slimy brown mud covers almost every inch of the stonework
in this dragon pen. It is riddled with small pieces of dragon feces and
creamy fragments of broken eggshells, having been shattered under foot and
mixed into the filth. There are still a few intact dragon eggs lying on the
far wall of the pen, though whether or not the baby dragons inside them
will ever hatch is a mystery. The air in this pen is thick and moist,
making it a perfect carrier for the utterly rancid stench that is emanating
from the brown slime that coats the area. It seems unimaginable that any
creature could actually live in these conditions.

    A tall black fence line draped with the banners of the White Dragonarmy
encases what appears to be a large training camp to the north. Clouds of
dust rise up into the sky from activities within, kicked up from the ground
and carried off by the blustering wind. Numerous stone structures seem to
be built within the camp's boundaries but the majority of the grounds seem
to be occupied by a central training area. An opening in the thick steel
fence line offers entrance to the White Dragonarmy training facility,
though unwelcome intrusions are probably met with swift serves of violence.

    Cowering in the shadows of the black city walls, this cobbled path is
almost completely lost in shadow. The roughly hewn cobbles are covered with
filth and trash, and the path probably hasn't been cleaned in months. More
care has been taken in hewing the stones used to make the massive walls,
clearly showing where the city's priorities lie. A dreary gloom hangs over
the area, and it would be unwise to linger here longer than necessary. The
dirty cobblestone path continues to the north and south, while an ominously
narrow passage between the looming walls leads to the east from here. The
tall pennants of the White Dragonarmy stand on the west side of the path.

    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

and stands can be seen, all with wonderous objects to sell. The market
isn't too large, but it does extend to the east for a little ways. A small
alley to the west seems to head away from the shops and toward the docks. A
small shop is to the north with a large wooden sign hanging just above the
entryway. A stand full of fresh fish can be seen to the south.

the rear. A few large grills have been set up in the back of the store to
cook up every kind of fish imaginable. A few tables sit in the front of the

    A very nice surprise in the midst of the market, the Gilded Parrot is a
quaint little inn. The receptionist desk is made of a beautiful piece of
oak with large birds carved into the front and sides. A small stair case
leads up to the rooms just behind the desk. The railing on the staircase is
also of oak with beautiful workmanship on it as well. A rather loud tavern
can be heard to the north, the sounds of enjoyment waft through the door
and wash over the inn's lobby.

unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting

    The sounds and smells of a market surround the area. Quite a few shops
and stands can be seen, all with wonderous objects to sell. The market
isn't too large, but it does extend to the east and west from this spot.
The bustle of the market can't manage to drown out the sounds of the docks
which are ways off to the west. A vegetable stand has been setup just south
of here by one of the nearby farmers. What appears to be a fishing supply
store stands to the north.

    The further away from the docks and fish stands, the less likely the
smell is to invade the area. This stand has almost avoided the fishy smell
altogether, there is even a hint of apple in the air. The fruits are
displayed on a wooden cart and lined up in rows. The stand is in shambles,
but the fruit appears to be in peak form, ripe and free from bruises.

executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

[36mDeath Row[0;37m
    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added

    Your footfalls echo off the bare walls of the stairwell. The stone feels
cold and damp to the touch only warming where flickering torches hang from
iron sconces set in the walls. The steps lead you down to the dungeons
where Balifor's criminals are locked away ... hopefully.

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

generally to both the north and south. The path to the south, though,
consists of a steep and treacherous decline. Large rocks on the trail
require caution for those moving northward.

    A large tree rooted to the side of the trail threatens to tumble down
the mountain side into the ogre village below. The trail here, while
mountainous, is relatively flat and straight, but to the north it clearly
becomes a much more difficult journey. Of course, the trail also leads east
toward the gates of the dwarven keep.

shows the street traders in their full colours. Small children play in the

against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and

    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the

fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The

source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Open doorways lead north and south from here, and a dark wood paneled
hallway runs straight to the east. Taking up a majority of the western wall
is a gate of light brown stone, set into a smooth archway that stands as
tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though
the safest path is anyone's guess.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    The tunnel takes an abrupt turn here, leading into darkness both south
and west. A melodic trickling sound echoes through the cavernous walls, its
source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.
