upon, one faulty step could send you plummeting over the edge to your
death. A large canyon spreads out below you, boxed in on all sides. From
this vantage point it appears that this trail is only entry or exit to the
canyon. A twinkling light shines from far out to the west, giving off the
presence of something that way. The trail can be taken down deeper into the
canyon's confines, or up onto the plateau overlooking the area below.

    You are standing in the corner of a box canyon. Steep walls of flaky
granite block any movement to the south or east. Climbing the walls is
impossible due to the crusty nature of the rock, any attempt to gain a
handhold results in a handful of granite. The walls echo every sound above
a whisper, but still the background is filled with the crash of falling
water nearby. Animal droppings and small stones lie underfoot, making
walking a dangerous and sometimes messy affair. A thin trail has been worn
into the side of the cliff, climbing it will be tough, but it is possible.

    You are standing in the corner of a box canyon. Steep walls of flaky
granite block any movement to the south or east. Climbing the walls is
impossible due to the crusty nature of the rock, any attempt to gain a
handhold results in a handful of granite. The walls echo every sound above
a whisper, but still the background is filled with the crash of falling
water nearby. Animal droppings and small stones lie underfoot, making
walking a dangerous and sometimes messy affair. A thin trail has been worn
into the side of the cliff, climbing it will be tough, but it is possible.

    The high walls of the canyon stand to the north and west, too high to

continually sends small pebbles falling in from above. Any noise in the
area echos about and comes back all garbled. The crash of falling water
nearby provides enough background noise to drown out most minor sounds. The
ground is littered with animal waste and small stones that have fallen in
from above.

this vantage point it appears that this trail is only entry or exit to the
canyon. A twinkling light shines from far out to the west, giving off the
presence of something that way. The trail can be taken down deeper into the
canyon's confines, or up onto the plateau overlooking the area below.

small pieces of the granite wall crumble off and fall to the bottom of the

the canyon. The main section of the plateau lies to the north and doesn't

    The beginnings of some grass foothills are present throughout the area.
Small hills crests and fall back to lower elevations at random intervals
all about this scenic spot. The hills become more grassy and lush to the
east. To the north the grass browns and rocky hills cover the area. Off to
the west a very flat piece of land covered in brownish grass extends. The
foothills meet a transition here from the rock and flat places of the
canyons into the lush green hills of lower mountains.

A large slope leads down to the east, toward a valley of bushes. To the

in close proximity is quite barren except for the occassional rock. Grass

    A slant of the land leads from the top of a few hills to the west down
into a small valley to the east. The distant west is not visible over the
crest of the hills, but to the east a small forest can be seen. The path
north is blocked by a rough briar patch, while south is stopped by the butt
of a large boulder. No way around the boulder can be seen. The area
underfoot is covered in short green grass, which provides easy walking if
it were not for the sharp slope.

    The foothills that surround the area block any view beyond what is in
the direct vicinity. A large amount of underbrush covers this small valley,
making walking painful at best. The bushes and grass move with the blowing
of the wind, yet the bushes to the south move and shake with a will of
their own. Nothing obvious appears different about them, except the violent
shaking and twitching. A small stand of trees surround the top of the hill
to the east, while a barren slope of grass leads upward to the west.

of interest remains in this exposed spot for very long, so the hill top is

are tall and friendly, but at dusk when the woods echo with the calls of
owls, they take on a much more sinister disposition, filled with the
creaking of branches and howling of beasts. During the day one could easily
spot the creatures that live in the forest, but by night the forest can
seem peculiarly lonely, in such a way that the traveler knows not who may
be concealed by the innumerable trunks and the thick broughs overhead; so
that with lonely footsteps he may yet be passing through an unseen
multitude.

from the mists, whispering cryptic words as the winds gust from the
Eastwall Mountains through their thick, sturdy branches. Though veiled by
the mists, you can hear the rustling of ferns beneath you, their fronds
tickling at your legs. You suddenly become cognizant of the ubiquitous
silence that seems to hang heavy from the thick brough of foliage above and
realize you are not alone.

    The tree has been hollowed, and actually is quite large inside - larger
than it looked from the outside. The wood around you is glowing a strange
green colour, as if it has been imbued with some strange form of druidic
magic. Small indentations lead up the inside of the tree in a spiralling
manner, providing a way to climb upwards, towards an opening at the top of
the tree that leads out into the open.

with shelves which are full of spell components of all sorts. Several small

which appears to have had its heart removed, likely as part of some vile
ritual. Small candles have been placed on the strange magical symbols on
the floor, which appear to have been painted in blood.

This particular pigmy is extremely short, thin, and has a very gaunt

for with his affinity for the arcane. Dozens of strange bone charms and
wooden trinkets dangle from a long necklace around his neck and they jingle
softly as he moves. His hands are weathered and wrinkled, and his long
fingernails are stained black with dirt. He is missing most of his teeth as
well as one of his eyes, which has been replaced with a glass bauble.

Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,

    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

    The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal
place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,
scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

grove of trees can be seen, standing lonely in the flat grasslands of the
plain. A gentle breeze blows, tossing the grasses back and forth, carrying
a slightly sweet smell with it. The road extends south toward Solanthus and
the Newsea, and northward toward Vingaard.

    The pier is a bit rickety, but it seems stable enough to walk on. Some
of the sailors from the nearby, docked ships walk down the pier and look
out over the Straits of Schallsea. You stop for a moment yourself and look

lies Solace and the lands of the elves. You strain to see that far, knowing
in your heart that it's impossible.

    A raised road leads on through the bog, continuing to the north and
south. The large bog can be seen to the north, east and west from here. The
road has been built up to maintain a dry and stable platform for the many
travellers passing through these parts. In some spots the bog has reclaimed
the land that once belonged to it. Foothills can be seen to the west, south
and south west directions. Far ahead to the north is a large plain.

    At this point, the road leads to the north through a bog and continues
to the south. The road has been built up with rocks and dirt to maintain a
dry and stable platform. However in some parts this is not the case and the
bog has reclaimed what originally belonged to it. The bog extends out for
quite some distance to the north and east and a bit to the west. Northward,
beyond the bog is a large plain. You see foothills off to the west, south

boulders, equally unscalable due to the smoothness of their weathered grey

    A small narrow path is here. The walls to your north and south are steep

water worn bedrock and piles of gravel and rounded cobbles. To the east, the
dwarves of Thorbardin have taken advantage of this and constructed an
unscalable wall to protect their keep. The path winds its way east, into the
heart of the mountain.

    The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

[36mFording the Vingaard River[0;37m
    The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal
place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,
scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

runs from the north to the south, cutting off the road just to the west.
The river flows gently through here, making it easy to ford and cross it.
The road extends southward through a small grove of trees, on into the

craft - feathers, bones and containers of all sorts. An awful smell
emanates from a pot on the fire, you wonder if it is dinner or a potion.

    The flow of the river turns northward here. On either side of the river
you see a beautiful landscape of trees and plains. To the west you are able
to get a glimpse of the huge city Kalaman. To the north, the river seems to
widen as the river flows into the Vingaard Estuary.

    There is little room to walk and maneuver on this small beach path
between the vast ocean to the north and the tall cliffs to the south.
Despite its size, the path is well-traveled by local fisherman who bring
their daily catch to markets in Vogler and Kalaman. Conspicuous shards of
broken coral lay scattered on the beach and path. The rocky path continues
to the east while a boat waits for fisherman to ferry them to Kalaman.

    The rocky path from the west ends here as tall cliffs block further
progress to the east. Numerous crustaceans crawl around in shallow pools
of water here, foraging for food while they wait for the tide to arrive.
A gap in the cliffs to the north leads to a calm harbor where fishing
boats can safely drop anchor. Beyond that, a sandbar rises out of the
expansive ocean. The Vingaard Estuary can barely be made out to the west
while to the south, cliffs form the edge of the path.

    Everything is calm here. The clear blue water beneath your feet is
mostly still with the occasional wind driven wave passing through. A soft
breeze blows through here and there, but nothing like the fierce winds of
the sea ahead. Several boats, belonging to local fishermen are moored here,
rocking in the wind. A small sandbar rises out of the water to north while
waves gently lap against the tall cliffs to the south.

    Shimmering hues of blue, green, and a peculiar gold, stream down from

the boats above from drifting away, dot the sandy bottom beneath the calm
harbor. Several sunken boats sit eerily on the harbor floor never again to
sail the seas. Farther to the north, sand and seashells have been gathered
by incoming waves, creating a mound rising slightly above the surface.

small palm tree growing on the sandbar flickers in and out of view as the
changing water plays with the light. There are scarcely any fish here. The
few that remain are thin, bony and have difficulty swimming. An expanse of
sandy underwater desert lies to the north. It gradually descends into the
murkier water below. Silhouettes of anchor lines can be seen to the south.

southerly direction. Just as below the harbor, thin and sickly fish swim by
slowly hanging on to life. Fish bones are scattered along the sea floor,
giving testament to the fishermen's complaints. The sandy expanse continues
to the north as far as the eye can see.

large enough for someone to climb through, has formed here against the edge
of the rock shelf. It leads down toward the fringes of the reef below. Odd
shards of bleached white coral line the entrance to the tunnel below.

    This tunnel is a natural phenomena in the coral reef that predates even
the great Cataclysm. It took hundreds of years for the coral-consuming
creatures of the reef to create. Every wall of the tunnel is a reminder of
the many species of coral that once lived here. Now all that remains are
several sea stars which form a semi-circle from the bottom of the western
wall to the bottom of the eastern wall. The tunnel continues down through
an opening in the coral while the cliff top lies above.

Above the pocket, stalks of living coral grow across the top keeping the

    The tunnel opens up into a large, most certainly intelligently carved
out section of the inner reef. Limited light filters through the canopy of
elkhorn coral above yet does not provide enough to illuminate the area.
Upon the southern and northern coral walls hang crudely built lanterns.
They are lit by living organisms which are caged within the glass lanterns.
Crude crates and racks of weaponry are scattered throughout the ground, a
common theme within the settlement. To the east, the settlement continues
toward the belly of the reef. To the west, the tunnel narrows towards the
exit back to the colorful reef above.

    The deepest part of this opulent coral cave is very neat and seems to
be well organized. A gigantic piece of strange blue leather hanging on the
back wall is covered with little bits of bone. It appears to be a map of
the northern ocean and is marked to highlight various locations that would
be of strategic importance for defending this settlement. Leaning against
the eastern wall is a weapons rack crafted from the bones of a dolphin. In
the center of the area is a large table, also crafted from dolphin bones,
where a few more blue leather maps are stacked next to an overturned skull
full of the little bits of bone used to mark them.

    The deepest part of this opulent coral cave is very neat and seems to
be well organized. A gigantic piece of strange blue leather hanging on the
back wall is covered with little bits of bone. It appears to be a map of
the northern ocean and is marked to highlight various locations that would
be of strategic importance for defending this settlement. Leaning against
the eastern wall is a weapons rack crafted from the bones of a dolphin. In
the center of the area is a large table, also crafted from dolphin bones,
where a few more blue leather maps are stacked next to an overturned skull
full of the little bits of bone used to mark them.

[36mAn Opulent Coral Cave[0;37m
    Glittering heaps of treasure lean against the western wall of this
spacious coral cave. Amongst the treasure lie beautiful oil paintings,
delicate pearl necklaces, beautiful ceremonial weapons, and towering
piles of shiny steel coins. It is surprising to find such treasures out
in the open and unguarded where anyone can swim by and take something.
The sahuagin leader who resides here is probably so fearsome that none
of his subordinates dare touch any of his treasure. Sitting against the
eastern wall is a large golden throne which is lined with dark sea grass
cushions. Behind the throne is a magnificent mosaic which stretches up
towards the upper reaches of the cave. The opulent cave continues to the
north while the rest of the settlement lies back to the southwest.

    This part of the natural coral tunnel is smooth and uncluttered. The
home of the leader of this sahuagin settlement must live nearby and dislike
disturbances. The canopy of elkhorn coral above is densely packed, but still
leaves enough room for small slivers of light to filter through though even
during the day. Since there is never enough light from above, the sahuagin
have affixed a crude glass lantern to the coral growing on the southern wall.
The intersection of tunnels lies back to the west while the water becomes
chillier to the east. A large coral cave branches off to the north.

to snap shut. Around the opening in the ceiling, a faded mosaic depicts a
battle in which the sahuagin victorious over the sea elves. Racks of crude
bronze weaponry are stacked several rows deep next to the statue. A stack
of rotting crates sits behind the large statue. The sahuagin settlement

[36mInside a Coral Cavern[0;37m
    This cavern is different from the rest of the coral tunnel. The walls
of the cavern are incredibly smooth, with no jagged edges or protruding
columns of dead coral. Seeing as there is no wave action this deep it is
odd how this came to be. The floor of the cave is sandy, silty and is home
to several species of sea grasses. An opening at the top of the cavern
allows light to filter through when the sun is up, while the western part
of the cavern lies in perpetual darkness.

    Oxygen from the immeasurable number of plants within the reef became
trapped here over the centuries creating a pocket of air within the reef.
Above the pocket, stalks of living coral grow across the top keeping the
air in place. As opposed to the water around you, the pocket of air is
devoid of life and the only thing one can do here is sit down and perhaps
rest for a while.

extends to the north, west and east. The sand here has been cleared from the

large enough for someone to climb through, has formed here against the edge
of the rock shelf. It leads down toward the fringes of the reef below. Odd
shards of bleached white coral line the entrance to the tunnel below.

[36mWithin a Natural Coral Tunnel[0;37m
    This tunnel is a natural phenomena in the coral reef that predates even
the great Cataclysm. It took hundreds of years for the coral-consuming
creatures of the reef to create. Every wall of the tunnel is a reminder of
the many species of coral that once lived here. Now all that remains are
several sea stars which form a semi-circle from the bottom of the western
wall to the bottom of the eastern wall. The tunnel continues down through
an opening in the coral while the cliff top lies above.

    The natural tunnel expands as it turns to the north. Despite the lack
of adequate sunlight, life still blooms down here below the massive coral
reef. The tunnel walls are jagged and rough. Yet despite their bleached
white color, they closely resembling the living coral above. Fish swim
through the tunnel and take shelter here. Baby lobsters, tiny shrimp and
purple sea urchins hide in small and large cracks in the tunnel walls.

of the cavern are incredibly smooth, with no jagged edges or protruding
columns of dead coral. Seeing as there is no wave action this deep it is
odd how this came to be. The floor of the cave is sandy, silty and is home
to several species of sea grasses. An opening at the top of the cavern
allows light to filter through when the sun is up, while the western part
of the cavern lies in perpetual darkness.

columns of dead coral. Seeing as there is no wave action this deep it is
odd how this came to be. The floor of the cave is sandy, silty and is home
to several species of sea grasses. An opening at the top of the cavern
allows light to filter through when the sun is up, while the western part
of the cavern lies in perpetual darkness.

    Below the ring colony of brain coral lies the food storage area for
this sahuagin settlement. Crudely built wooden crates along the walls are
stacked one on top of the other. The crates are decaying slowly in the salt
water, so occasionally, chunks of rotting fish will escape and float away.
It is no wonder that the fish and lobsters above are keen to stay near the
ring of brain coral. To the west, a rotting vallenwood door barely hang on
to a set of rusty hinges embedded into the coral wall.

[36mThe Sahuagin Settlement[0;37m
    Covered by a canopy of elkhorn coral, the settlement enjoys relative
safety from the many dangers of the reef above. Poorly constructed racks and
and crates in this area of the settlement are filled with hundreds of bronze
weapons. The sahuagin must be preparing for something big if they have been
amassing such a large arsenal. A fairly large tunnel extends to the west,
leading away from the settlement and towards the edges of the reef. Scraps
of dead fish and crustacean float in from the east. To the north, a large
statue of a striking shark is visible through the dark water.

[36mThe Sahuagin Settlement[0;37m
    Along this leg of the tunnels, the sahuagin have excavated temporary
homes for themselves. Unfortunately, since these coral caves were hastily
constructed, some of them have collapsed on their tenants. A few crushed
limbs sticking out of the rubble appear to have been chewed to shreds, as
sahuagin who died during the collapses have no further use for their flesh.
The one remaining cave off to the west appears to be pretty cluttered, as
if the sahuagin aren't good at cleaning up after themselves. At least the
surrounding coral appears to be fairly sturdy.

[36mOutskirts of a Crude Settlement[0;37m
    Deep in the reef core, the fringes of the sahuagin settlement are bare
and mostly desolate. The area looks bleak, as if the sahuagin had dug in
this direction, but decided to leave the area undeveloped. It is unclear
whether this is because they got tired of digging, had constructed enough
homes, or found something they didn't want to live near. What is clear,
however, is that the water to the south, away from the settlement, smells
much fresher than the waters back to the north.

[36mBefore an Underwater Geyser[0;37m
    The coral tunnel slopes upwards as it continues to the south, slowly
transitioning to stone as the tunnel penetrates the bedrock that the
reef formation grows upon. The stone is scarred with thousands of deep
gouges from when the sahuagin tried to dig through the rock. It is clear
that what stopped them from digging any deeper into the bedrock is the
powerful underwater geyser that lies through an opening to the south.
Anything caught in the surging geyser would be pushed up out of the rock
and into the sky, but there is no guarantee of a safe landing.

    Crumbling bits of tombstone lie scattered about the weeds as they have
been neglected over the years. The contrast of stark white bones against
the rich, dark soil can be seen in some patches of earth. The ground is
uneven, as if some of the graves have been upheaved. The eerie silence of
the graveyard is enough to make a kender tremble.

past. However, this place is so run-down and ill-kept that there is no
trace of the person's name anywhere. In the center of the room is a
sturdy-looking coffin with its lid nailed tightly shut. Strangely, there
are fingerprints on the coffin and many footprints on the ground.

fields, and toward the river.

paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off to
the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.
