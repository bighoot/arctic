    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    A narrow road leads south through the edge of the plains and into a
thick vallenwood forest. An arm of the Kharolis mountains lies to the west
and extends out to the north, the road turns east to lead away from the
mountains on its journey through the plains. The plains of Abanasinia
spread out to the northeast from here and you see another mountain range
off to the east. A thick forest of tall trees can be seen to the south.

    A narrow road here runs east through some plains toward the Eastwall
mountains while to the west the road continues through the plains. The
plains spread out to the west for a short distance before ending at an arm
of the Kharolis mountains. The Kharolis mountains lie off to the west and
run north-south in this area of Abanasinia. The foothills of the Eastwall
mountains can be seen off to the east and the mountain range appears to run
northeasterly from this spot.

    Waves from the Newsea crash onto the shoreline, sending spray of salty
water into the air. Strong gusts from the north whip at your clothes and
kick sand and water droplets into your face. From the eastern horizon to
the western horizon, all that can be seen are the waters of the Newsea.
Directly across the waters to the north you can barely make out a land mass
and a city, it must be Port o'Call. The sand along the shore becomes more
sparse to the south and a road leads away from the shoreline.

the forest of Silvanesti. The southern tip of the Khalkist mountains lies a
great distance towards the west, and rise up like towering giants. Beyond
that, though not visible, lies the waters of New Sea. Ogre Peaks and Onyx
Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name
suggests, is home to many ogres. The land to the north is a mighty plain
known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.

careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent

distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest

    This narrow road winds a treacherous path through these grim foothills.
The trail is rocky and somewhat unstable, through clumps of pine trees and
the occasional hardwood, though other than that the terrain is rather
monotonous. The land is hilly, though not altogether rugged, as most of the
hillsides that comprise the area are grassy or covered with small rocks.
The jagged, violent peaks of the Khalkist Mountains sneer at you high
above to the north.

    The narrow road twists and winds around the larger foothills here.
These hills are the southern extent of the mightly Khalkist Mountains which
loom over you to the north. The peaks are such a bleak, dark grey, they
almost look charred against the sky. To the south the rocky road flattens
somewhat into more hilly foothills while those to the north only become
more treacherous and rocky. In the distance you can see faint signs of
smoke barely rising above the foothills far to the southwest.

    The lands of Ak-Tubal and Kalin Ak-Phan stretch out to the east. They
are flat, dry, grassy plains infamous for their unbearable heat during the
summer solstice. Although the conditions can be harsh, you can see several
clumps of hardwoods providing some shade for travellers. Far east beyond
the huge plains you can barely make out the glittering waves of the Khurman
Sea. The altitude descends north of there, though to the south you can see
the jagged, towering peaks of the mighty Khalkist Mountains.

    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

[36mBottom of the Main Lift[0;37m
    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of
the mountain above. Complicated gears and pulleys seem to work together in
an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

[36mThe Entrance to Deep Mine[0;37m
    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

torches above the sign. Many of the villagers walk about here. A group of
merchants mills around, having recently arrived from the main elevator

    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

stalagmites continues to the west and to the south; You just need to be
careful of running into rocks. While the area is somewhat plain, it appears
as if this road is still used fairly regularly.

    Small rocks protruding out of the road force a high degree of caution
as you range through the subterranean caverns. Small colonies of lichen
grow on the various stalagmites found all over the area. To the north and
south the winding road through the stalagmites continues. The dim light of
a low fire seems to reach the path from the west.

    A big rock protrudes out of the ground here, forcing you to dodge
around it as you walk down the path. Huge stalagmites rising out of the
ground obstruct passage to the west and south. Instead, they lead the path
to the north and east. Some small colonies of lichen seem to have developed
a taste for the stalagmites as a home, as they have begun to grow in the

Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

    The walls in this portion of the stalagmite are very different from
those previously encountered. There are no smooth curves, bumps, or odd
colors. Coffee-colored walls surround this small cavern and capture the
moist air and smells that waft in from other areas of the stalagmite. This
bubble in the stalagmite appears to contain less moisture than the other
ones, but it still has collected several small puddles on the floor. Cloved
hoofprints can be found all over, none leading in any particular direction.

    Dark gray walls climb to the ceiling of this massive stalagmite.
Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the

Lanai flies in from above.
[36mBehind the Dragon's Skull[0;37m
    Mud puddles line a path, leading directly into the back of a giant
dragon's mouth. A small opening is easily visible between the skull and the
mandible. The mud here has a strange sweet smell that is surprisingly
pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem
terrifyingly bigger than the ones seen above. Most of the hoofprints seem
to be leading east, where the mud gets thicker.

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small

have spent their time recuperating energy. The path to the west looks a

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's

signifying a regularly boisterous patronage. The tunnel extending from this
point appears to be less often travelled than the large Main Way of the
city. A faint smell of decay wafts into the room from the north.

    Fabulous aromas assault the senses from all sides of this compact
kitchen. Over the fire-pit a huge pig is roasting slowly, while at the
stove bread bakes to a fine golden brown. A bookshelf on the southern wall
holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a
priest of Reorx. A window set on the northern wall is open, in the
unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,
while the backdoor of the Burrow is framed near the window.

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

[36mBefore a Humble Inn[0;37m
    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

Surprisingly, the tunnel east, while plenty big enough for the carts, has
no tracks leading in that direction. Villagers are plentiful in the area of

the benches, which have been erected around the junction sign. Torches
bring an abundance of light to this underground tunnel.

the huge vallenwood trees that cover the Solace Vale. Stretching out to the
north, these fields are known as Nearfields to the citizens of Solace
because of their proximity to the small town. A thick forest of pine trees
lies to the west, beyond which the Crystalmir Lake can be seen. To the east
this dirt trail merges with a wide road.

[36mA Narrow Road[0;37m
    A narrow road leads deep into a thick forest of very tall trees and
north it leads through the plains of Abanasinia. Around you are many trees
but not as many as to the south. The road runs in the near shadows of the
Kharolis mountains which can be seen off to the west, beyond a great lake.
The mountains appear to run north for some distance before ending. The
plains spread out to the north from here for many leagues.

[36mA Narrow Road[0;37m
    This narrow, dirt road winds its way through the great forest, curving
around large trees and rocks. You can hear the chattering of hundreds of
animals all around you, and a few of the trees seem to have large claw
marks. To the south, lies the northern gate of Solace, and to the north,
the road continues. Large bushes block your view to the east and west.

[36mThe Northern Gate of Solace[0;37m
    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.
