    The low ceiling holds the smoke and noise close to the floor in this
busy inn. A dozen long tables stand scattered about the room and a narrow
stair in the back leads to the upper floor. Along the south wall, a
fieldstone hearth holds a rotating spit. Several groups of adventurers are
clustered about the various tables, each eying the others suspiciously and
planning their campaigns in muted tones.

    A warm, smoky place, the Drunken Dwarf is a favorite hangout for
townies and militia alike. Heavy, utilitarian wooden tables and benches
fill most of the room. Overhead are the exposed beams of a high ceiling.
Sawdust covers the floor to help absorb frequent beer spills. At the back
of the room is a long bar with a menu hanging behind. To the south is a
small, closed door with a sign affixed to it.

    Dwarven craftsmen took pride in the work it took to lay these paving

    Balthazaar has decided to settle down in Tarsis. Once doing business
from a magically-enhanced wagon, he now is the proud owner of a shiny new
store. His housekeeping hasn't improved much, though--stacks of dusty old
books and seemingly unorganized piles of scrolls and vials litter every
horizontal surface of the place. On the counter running across the front of
the room rests the same crusty old business ledger.

growing on these rocky soils, and the slightest green of a stubborn moss is

that, though not visible, lies the waters of New Sea. Ogre Peaks and Onyx
Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name
suggests, is home to many ogres. The land to the north is a mighty plain
known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.
Skirting the northern tip of the Silvanesti forest, the road continues east
into the lands of Khur.

careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent

distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

from the northeast. The Khurman Sea, also known as the Bay of Balifor, is

boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or

    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of
the mountain above. Complicated gears and pulleys seem to work together in
an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral

praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west

Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

A bright red beard and burly muscles are hardly the only things to see when
looking upon this impressive dwarf. His deep green eyes reveal wisdom beyond
his years and a twinkle on his lips reveals a quick wit. Shuba is wearing an
old white apron, covered in old grease stains and singe marks. He sports a
clever looking chef's hat, so that everyone can see who he is.

    Dark gray walls climb to the ceiling of this massive stalagmite.
Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural
wonderland.

    On both sides of a long dried path are huge puddles of a strangely
sweet-smelling mud. Thankfully, the path provides relief from the messy
mud-covered entrance of the stalagmite. Cloved prints pockmark the path,
too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room. The
path leads to the south and north, where a sickening smell seems to be
coming from.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

    Mud puddles line a path, leading directly into the back of a giant
dragon's mouth. A small opening is easily visible between the skull and the
mandible. The mud here has a strange sweet smell that is surprisingly
pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem
terrifyingly bigger than the ones seen above. Most of the hoofprints seem
to be leading east, where the mud gets thicker.

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area

    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area
below.

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the

charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the

heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side

lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

[36mJunction One[0;37m
    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

    A clear junction spot of the Main Way, the area is labeled with a huge
sign reading only the number three. Huge tread marks in the ground lead to
the north and west, clearly paths for mining carts along the Main Way.
Surprisingly, the tunnel east, while plenty big enough for the carts, has
no tracks leading in that direction. Villagers are plentiful in the area of
this junction, some chatting wildly with each other, while others sit on
the benches, which have been erected around the junction sign. Torches
bring an abundance of light to this underground tunnel.

into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

THE DIVINITY SKILL
  Format: divinity

The gods of divine power shine down upon the cleric, providing bonus
memorization speed and concentration for the duration. Other affects, such
as the ability to detect the purity of souls, may appear at higher skill
level. The power of divinity is known to help smite down enemies, adding
bonus damage to offensive spells for the duration. However, after several
offensive damage spells are cast, the divine link to the Gods will be
severed.

Details:
- Utility skill which provide a number of benefits to the caster,
  including a bonus to CONCENTRATION_FACTOR and single target spell damage.
- At higher skill levels may grant DETECT_GOOD and DETECT_EVIL, the
  benefits of MENTAL_ACUITY, a bonus to SPELL_SAVES_MOD, and DETECT_UNDEAD.

    This rough road winds its way through foothills near the Khalkist
Mountains which lay to the west. Lush, flat plains extend to the east and
northeast. These hills are green, dotted by the occasional dark grey
boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or
civilization can be seen in sight, as there are few footprints and no wagon
ruts on this rugged road.

    The lands of Ak-Tubal and Kalin Ak-Phan stretch out to the east. They
are flat, dry, grassy plains infamous for their unbearable heat during the
summer solstice. Although the conditions can be harsh, you can see several
clumps of hardwoods providing some shade for travellers. Far east beyond
the huge plains you can barely make out the glittering waves of the Khurman
Sea. The altitude descends north of there, though to the south you can see
the jagged, towering peaks of the mighty Khalkist Mountains.

    The elevated highway that is King's road rises thirty feet beyond the
ground. Having been broken during the Cataclysm, the road is now a shell of
its former self. Aside from the road's state of disrepair, it sits too high
from the ground to be travelled on. Still, the ancient road serves as a
worthy guide through the harsh plains and towards the kingdom of
Silvanesti. To the west, the road has collapsed, leaving behind tall
pillars of stone that stretch out towards the sky and supporting nothing.

    King's Road runs parallel to the Khaldat river, too high and too
ruined to be used as a means of transport. Broken columns reach towards the
sky, a reminder of what was and what will never be, while the saffron
colored sands blow in invisible winds. The faint sound of scurrying can be
detected if one ignores the bubbling burble of the broad river stretching
east and south into the Plains of Dust. The sound is probably from the
small animals that call the desolation their home.

    This once grand and beautifully crafted highway has been ravaged by the
harsh surrounding sands. It is said that King's Road once cut entirely
across what is now known as the Plains of Dust, leading all the way to
Sancrist. There is, however, little proof of King's Road extending beyond
this point, as anything that may lie further west is buried beneath the
sands. The road has collapsed, leaving heaps of rubble and debris on the
sands. King's road continues east, but is inaccessible from the ground.
Instead a much simpler road has been formed and runs alongside it's base.

expand to the northwest. As you gaze over the contents of the valley, you
notice a small town nestled deep in the valley. Wisps of black smoke drift
lazily into the air, and signs of life become more apparant as there are
many visible footprints, not yet covered by dust.

    The Plains of Dust surround you. Barren, rocky soil offers little
vegetation, only monotony. Icereach and the Icewall glacier cannot be seen
from this distance, though you can feel their bitter winds. This road winds
its way east to where the dust clouds that billow about the plains
diminish, and west towards the city of Tarsis. Pale white clouds hang
lazily in the air when you speak and breathe, until a strong gust of wind
destroys them. The landscape is barren and rocky, and your feet are numb
despite all efforts to protect them.

from the south as they drift violently in from the depths of the Icewall
glaciers. Dry skies expand overhead, as rain is a commodity in these
parts of Krynn. You can barely make out Tarsis, lying nestled in the heart
of the plains west from here. More dust greets you to the east.

    A jaded, frigid, azure sky expands above you, a swirling sea of cloud
and wind. Pummeling you from the south, glacial winds send clouds of dust
billowing around you. The howling winds scream into your ears and tear at
your clothes, as if rogue, elemental scavengers. Barren, rocky soil offers
little comfort from the relentless winds, and the only sign of life you can
see is deep wagon ruts on this well-travelled road, most of which seem to
be headed east to west, towards the city of Tarsis.

    This, the road to Tarsis, strides boldly through the Plains of Dust,
plunging eastward through the plains and west towards the exotic city of
Tarsis. Glacial winds gust in from the south, hampering your journey. The
plains respond to these forceful winds, born in the heart of Icewall, with
incredible dust storms that constantly threaten to encroach upon Tarsis and
the roads leading to her. Very few plants have the will or tenacity to try
growing on these rocky soils, and the slightest green of a stubborn moss is
a sight for sore eyes.

    The fortified walls of Tarsis rise up from the Plains of Dust like
mighty cliffs, defiant against the cold, harsh winds, and dwarfed only by
the fifty foot towers that nearly encircle the city. The ancient city walls
have withstood the tests of time, including the Cataclysm in all of its
fiery glory. Once called Tarsis the Beautiful, the Lordcity was a bustling
sea port, whose rich commerce brought sustainability and prosperity to the
land. The city now looks as desolate as the plains that surround it.
Tempestuous winds assail the walls with endless specks of sand, causing
minimal damage to the walls, but serving as a constant reminder that
nothing can survive forever in these wastelands.

    The chapel is dedicated to the god Gilean. Stone walls reach high to
the arched ceiling. Several rows of plain wooden pews have been neatly
arranged facing a simple altar beneath the apse. On top of the altar sits a
scale of balance resting on an open book. The entryway to the south leads
to an antechamber.

    Rows upon rows of bookshelves sprawl out in every direction. A wide
balcony encircles the upper region of the library and the rows of
bookshelves on the floor below. Every square inch of the walls are covered
in bookshelves, upon which lie thousands of ancient tomes. Rival to the
Great Library of Palanthas, this library was once thought to have been lost
in the Cataclysm. There is no telling what secrets and wonders lie within
the pages of the books here.

[36mDocument Restoration[0;37m
    This simply adorned room only appears to contain a few desks, but
somehow each desk appears to emit bright light which illuminates the papers
on the surface. Several open books and spare pages lie on each desk, while
a variety of quills and inks sit in small side trays. The desk closest to
the entryway appears to be a collection point for restoration work, and the
pile seems especially high. This room is clearly regularly cleaned and
maintained, and in addition to the bright restoration desks this space is
well lit by wall sconces.

also wears a sword along his belt and bears the look of a soldier.

from the ceiling, and there are small wheel levers and pipe openings every
few feet allowing individual showers with control over water flow. The
entire room from ceiling to floor is constructed of small white stone tiles
which have been stained brown, pink and black over time from water
minerals. The entire floor is sloped gently toward the centre to allow
water to flow into a central floor drain.

    This row of bookshelves appears to have previously run from west to
east, but all of the bookshelves along the north wall of the library have
been been completely crushed under what looks like a fallen slab of stone
from the balcony above. Not surprisingly the bookshelves along this row
have all been destroyed, and broken remnants of the ancient vallenwood
shelves litter the floor. The path to the west is completely impassable due
to the clutter of collapsed shelves and stone debris. To the east the
remains of the fallen slab lay upon the shattered shelves. There is a
significant amount of rubble and debris scattered about the area.

bookshelves it has been used as a storage space for old reading tables and
other library equipment. The Aesthetics have put considerable work into

    A stark contrast to the nearby rows, the bookshelves here have been
reduced to a large pile of rubble blocking passage in some directions. The
shelves that are still visible are broken and covered in dust, with many
books lost to the ages. Far above the bookshelf remnants there are wide
skylights that are dark and barely visible, offering no additional light.
The Aesthetics speak of this section with deep sadness, lamenting the
knowledge lost. It is difficult to move without stepping on rocks and
debris and to continue on the path north or east would be impossible.

of the room is very utilitarian and sparsely furnished. The guardsman side
of the room has been refurnished using pillows and furniture from

    This simply adorned room only appears to contain a few desks, but
somehow each desk appears to emit bright light which illuminates the papers
on the surface. Several open books and spare pages lie on each desk, while
a variety of quills and inks sit in small side trays. The desk closest to
the entryway appears to be a collection point for restoration work, and the
pile seems especially high. This room is clearly regularly cleaned and
maintained, and in addition to the bright restoration desks this space is
well lit by wall sconces.

    A stark contrast to the nearby rows, the bookshelves here have been
reduced to a large pile of rubble blocking passage in some directions. The
shelves that are still visible are broken and covered in dust, with many
books lost to the ages. Far above the bookshelf remnants there are wide
skylights that are dark and barely visible, offering no additional light.
The Aesthetics speak of this section with deep sadness, lamenting the
knowledge lost. It is difficult to move without stepping on rocks and
debris and to continue on the path north or east would be impossible.

bookshelves it has been used as a storage space for old reading tables and
other library equipment. The Aesthetics have put considerable work into

which have been stained brown, pink and black over time from water
minerals. The entire floor is sloped gently toward the centre to allow

    This simple but elegant hallway is a brief reprieve from the nearby
maze of bookshelves. The hall here is well lit by round glowing orbs which
rest atop silver wall sconces and shine light to every corner and crevice.
It's difficult to discern the material of the sheer white walls to the
north and south, but unlike the rest of this aging library they appear
flawless. There is a large doorway set in the northern wall, an even larger
set of doors to the west lead to the library, and the hallway continues
eastward.

    In its past use this may have been a meeting room of some sort, however
the Aesthetics and guards appear to have repurposed this room as the
sleeping quarters because of its large size. Beds line the walls with an
obvious delineation between the guards and Aesthetics. The Aesthetics' side
of the room is very utilitarian and sparsely furnished. The guardsman side
of the room has been refurnished using pillows and furniture from
throughout the library to make themselves more comfortable. There are large
sets of doors in the north and south ends of the sleeping quarters and a
smaller doorway in the east wall between the Aesthetic bunks.

    This room serves as a small bathhouse for the library staff, except
instead of baths the room has been built as showers of water that can be
used while standing. A small copper pipe rings the room wall about a foot
from the ceiling, and there are small wheel levers and pipe openings every
few feet allowing individual showers with control over water flow. The
entire room from ceiling to floor is constructed of small white stone tiles
which have been stained brown, pink and black over time from water
minerals. The entire floor is sloped gently toward the centre to allow
water to flow into a central floor drain.

    It would take a keen eye to find a speck of dust among these
bookshelves after the hard work of the aesthetics. The shelves appear to go
on forever, housing hundreds of books. Far above the highest shelves the
ceiling appears to have wide skylights which have been covered with earth
and rock. There is an eerie silence about this place, and each footstep
echoes almost eternally.

as a room registry. Belle sits behind a pine counter, quietly reading,
until a customer arrives. Behind her is a long rack of wooden cubbyholes
and hooks holding room keys. Long halls with many closed doors stretch to
either side. It's quiet and well-kept here, conducive to a good night's
