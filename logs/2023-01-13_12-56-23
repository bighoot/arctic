    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

You carefully begin to untie the ribbon binding the prayerbook.
As you release the frail pages from their gossamer prison you cradle them
gently in your hands, careful not to damage them as you study the knowledge
they contain. The pages suddenly begin to glow and quickly fly out of your
hands. They twist about in the air for a few terrible moments and then
simply fall into place within your own personal prayerbook. You find the
spell 'cure disease' neatly in place and smile broadly, thanking the gods.
The silk ribbon tightens around the now empty gossamer and both vanish with
a loud POP!

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most

    Plains expand all around you from this parched, hot dry road. The dirt
of which the road is made is cracked and dry with lack of moisture, and
very few plants other than the occasional cactus dare grow in such a trying
environment. The odd reptile slithers across the path, and there are very
few opportunities for respite along the road. In the distance to the north,
a camp can be seen.

    This large road, composed mostly of dry, dusty dirt, winds its way
across the parched yellow grasses of the plains towards Delphon to the
west, and to a crossroad east of here. The wind carries with it the sounds
of Delphon, a large city whose towering black gates glitter in both
darkness and light. Many travelers pass you by, most heading west towards
the great city of Delphon or beginning the trek to Port Balifor which rests
south of here, along the shores of the Khurman Sea. The breeze dies down a
bit, replaced with the cawing of vultures overhead.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

tower itself has been constructed of a magical mix of corals. Some of the
corals are alive adding a glittering silver flourescence to the tower. The
living corals, though, seem to be growing from a base of extremely sturdy
petrified coral. The doorway is quite massive. It has been constructed from
mithril and had individual embossed gold panels. The panels are decorated
with a brilliant silver moon and a cerulean dolphin curled so that its nose
is almost touching its tail. To the east the jade gates of the palace glow
a brilliant green, while to the west there is a small garden for the
tower's inhabitants.

[36mA Large Coral Antechamber[0;37m
    The entrance to the Tower of the Moon is an enormous antechamber made
from glittering silver coral that emits a soft, soothing light. The floor
is made of pale pink marble that must be regularly polished by the Tower
servants. To the east, a hole in the coral serves as a guard's house. The
tiny room is empty except for a small sponge bunk, and a marvelous piece
of glowing green coral. The corridor curves to both the west and south,
while the mithril doors in the northern wall allow an easy exit from the
Tower. Glittering coral corridors lead to the west and south from here,
and enormous bubbles seem grow from the walls in both directions.

    The entrance to the Tower of the Moon is an enormous antechamber made
from glittering silver coral that emits a soft, soothing light. The floor
is made of pale pink marble that must be regularly polished by the Tower
servants. To the east, a hole in the coral serves as a guard's house. The
tiny room is empty except for a small sponge bunk, and a marvelous piece
of glowing green coral. The corridor curves to both the west and south,
while the mithril doors in the northern wall allow an easy exit from the
Tower. Glittering coral corridors lead to the west and south from here,
and enormous bubbles seem grow from the walls in both directions.

    The corridor arrives at this tremendous staircase made from the shell
of what once must have been a giant sea snail the size of fifteen elves. The
shell spirals up into the heart of the Tower of the Moon. An alcove on the
northern wall of the corridor houses the statue of what must have been one
of the most beautiful dargonesti ever to rule the sea elves. On the southern
wall, a mosaic displays part of the history of the Darthallans. This mosaic
reflects off the well-polished pink marble floor. Other stories depicted on
the massive mosaic are visible far to the east and west.

    Atop the yellow-spotted shell of what was once a gigantic snail, the
second floor of the Tower of the Moon takes shape. To the north, double
doors made of petrified redwood, perhaps salvaged from a sunken ship, mark
the entrance to the Chambers of the Council. A glittering coral corridor
is visible to the east, where it bends northwards. The floor is made of a
light blue marble, punctuated by an opening that leads down the shell to
the bottom floor of the Tower.

    The glittering coral of the walls light the corridor here, where it
abruptly comes to an end. Sea creatures swim through the ocean beyond an
opening in the white coral ceiling. On the northern wall, a brilliant
silver moon is embedded into the coral, marking the end of this sacred
passage. To the west lies a pair of petrified redwood doors which lead
into the Chambers of the Council. The corridor back into the rest of the
tower bends southwest along the light blue marble floor.

swim directly into side walls here, vanishing momentarily, before they
reappear on the other side. This magical plane connects the Speaker of the

    The corridor curves to the southwest here. The glittering silver coral
from which the corridor is constructed lights bending the passage. Along
the western wall, there is the beginning of an enormous relief chiseled out
of the calcified polyps of dead coral. The relief is intricately designed,
and it depicts a horde of evil sea creatures departing from a dark citadel.
The corridor's pink marble floor continues to the south and east.

    Continuing down the corridor, lit by the glittering silver coral, is
quite the experience. The central part of the relief dominates the western
wall and depicts Darthalla's bravest warriors swimming into battle. To the
east is a small alcove in the coral wall, filled with an impressive statue
of a former leader of the Darthallans. The pink marble floor continues to
both the northeast and southeast.

remarkable story of the Darthallans. The pink marble floor seems to be more

of the mosaic is visible in the floor. The path is lit by the magnificent
glittering silver coral and continues to southeast and northwest.

    The corridor arrives at this tremendous staircase made from the shell
of what once must have been a giant sea snail the size of fifteen elves. The
shell spirals up into the heart of the Tower of the Moon. An alcove on the
northern wall of the corridor houses the statue of what must have been one
of the most beautiful dargonesti ever to rule the sea elves. On the southern
wall, a mosaic displays part of the history of the Darthallans. This mosaic
reflects off the well-polished pink marble floor. Other stories depicted on
the massive mosaic are visible far to the east and west.

of what once must have been a giant sea snail the size of fifteen elves. The
shell spirals up into the heart of the Tower of the Moon. An alcove on the
northern wall of the corridor houses the statue of what must have been one
of the most beautiful dargonesti ever to rule the sea elves. On the southern
wall, a mosaic displays part of the history of the Darthallans. This mosaic
reflects off the well-polished pink marble floor. Other stories depicted on
the massive mosaic are visible far to the east and west.

    Atop the yellow-spotted shell of what was once a gigantic snail, the
second floor of the Tower of the Moon takes shape. To the north, double
doors made of petrified redwood, perhaps salvaged from a sunken ship, mark
the entrance to the Chambers of the Council. A glittering coral corridor
is visible to the east, where it bends northwards. The floor is made of a
light blue marble, punctuated by an opening that leads down the shell to
the bottom floor of the Tower.

[36mIn the Middle of the Ocean[0;37m
    Standing solidly in the middle of the ocean is a strange feeling,
replicable only in the Hall of the Moon. From above a bright silver light
fills the chamber and makes visible the aquatic life swimming nearby.
Schools of fish, old sea turtles, and dolphins all seem to be playing
happily in the water without realizing that anyone could be right here in
their midst. From here, following the light is an obvious choice.

    The Chambers of the Council is the sacred meeting place of the Council
of the Seas. This council has weighed on important issues facing the races
of sea people through the ages. Dominating the center of the chambers is a
beautiful table, constructed from petrified ironwood. Around the table are
some sponge chairs, which frequently go unused as Council members prefer
floating in the water. The chambers can be exited through doors made of
petrified wood to both the south and east.

petrified coral. The doorway is quite massive. It has been constructed from
mithril and had individual embossed gold panels. The panels are decorated
with a brilliant silver moon and a cerulean dolphin curled so that its nose
is almost touching its tail. To the east the jade gates of the palace glow

    A variety of decorative elements fill this large courtyard paved with
polished coral tiles. Framed by criss-crossing branches of bright pink
coral, the statue of a slender young elf dominates the southwest corner.
To the statue's left, an ancient bas-relief sculpture stands out from the
thick coral wall, while to his right, the perimeter of the courtyard is
defined by carefully pruned stalks of green kelp. Since the courtyard is
open to the sea, the ocean surface is visible high above, and occasionally
a school of small fish will swim through the peaceful courtyard.

The soapy bubble around you floats through the opening in the ceiling.

You suddenly find yourself tumbling head over heels as the buoyant bubble
rockets upwards towards the ocean's surface. As you float upwards, the
pressure from the surrounding water eases, and the bubble quickly expands
around you. Your head throbs from the sudden change in pressure!

Abruptly, the bubble passes through the threshold of the ocean's surface,
and it bursts open, spilling you out onto the sea!

[36mIn the Open Sea[0;37m
    The vast Turbidus Ocean stretches endlessly in all directions, its
clear water as blue as the sky when the sun is out. When the seas are calm,
the water glitters like an fluttering blanket of fireflies. But when a
storm comes, the crashing waters are powerful enough to capsize even the
most stable ships. A gentle zephyr sweeps across the ocean's rhythmically
undulating surface.
[33m[1m[0;37m[31m[1m[0;37mDazed, you splash upon the cool surface of the ocean!

[36mA Beautiful Coral Palace[0;37m
    The central part of this beautiful palace is defined by a large dome
of bright orange star coral that arches gracefully overhead. A delicate
crystal chandelier hangs from the apex of the dome, held up by a thick
iridium chain. On the northern wall, a colorful framed mosaic of above a
gold and coral cabinet. An iridescent pearl vase filled with thin coral
rods sits in the center of a large round table that dominates the palace.
A pair of whale bone chairs frame the doorway to the east, while a large
courtyard and garden lie beyond the archway to the south.

    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
