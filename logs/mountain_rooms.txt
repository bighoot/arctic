Along the Sentinel Mountains [54245] <Inside> 
    Bleak and insurmountable, the rocky face of the Sentinel Mountains
creates an impassable barrier to the east. The caps of the mountains
glisten with white, and a cold wind can be felt when it rushes down the
slopes into the westwards grassy plains which stretch out as far as the eye
can see. A faint trail, barely visible between the wayward rocks and
stunted trees, runs alongside the mountains. Some distance to the north the
wooded hills of the Ker-Li peek out from the mountainside.

Along the Sentinel Mountains [54246] <Inside> 
    Stunted trees make their bleak subsistance to the south, running along
the narrow transition of the westward grassy savannahs of the Empire of
Ergoth and the eastward Sentinel Mountains. These trees struggle to find
purchase in the narrow, stony soil of the piedmont, but grow taller to the
north, as the slopes begin to soften, affording pines and even a few
shorter hardwoords. Among the slender pines to the north the wooden homes
of the Ker-Li can be seen. The faint path stretches southwards along the
foot of the mountains towards a single wooden tower, barely visible in the
distance.

Along the Sentinel Mountains [54244] <Inside> 
    Bare shade is afforded by the small copse of sourwood trees which have
somehow managed a bleak subsistance along the rocky foot of the Sentinel
Mountains. To the west a vast sea of grass, taller than a gnome, moves
gently in the faint breeze, waving ever onwards to the Emperor's Bay almost
one hundred miles beyond the verdant vertiginousness. A thin trail meanders
between the grass and the stony wall of the mountains. A single, tall,
wooden tower can be seen some distance to the south.

Ker-Li [54282] <Hills> 
    The remote village of the Ker-Li has its outskirts here, in the place
where the rolling hills of Ergoth transition into the Sentinel Mountains. A
few scattered wooden homes of the poorer Ackalite barbarians are visible
here, built from the evergreen pines which dot the hills and lower
mountains. The homes themselves are small and poorly made, suggesting that
life in these hilly barrens is difficult.

The Woods of the Ker-Li [54331] <Inside> 
    Deep in the forest, some distance west of the Ker-Li village and the
Sentinel Mountains, the Ergothian wilds run strong and unchecked. Tall
pines sway back and forth in the winds, scattering their needles along the
forest floor, creating a thick carpet which swallows any sound. The animals
in the part of the forest seem more demure, almost as if some larger
predator were always afoot, endangering the squirrels and thrushes which
would otherwise fill the copses with their chatter. A faint, almost
indetectable, odor of rotting flesh wafts between the juniper-scented
breezes.

Skirting the Ker-Li Village [54332] <Inside> 
    Beyond the tall partitions of the Ker-Li village lie the glades and
copses of the Sentinel Mountain piedmont. Birdsong echoes along the distant
granite face, and the trees seem to creak and groan in their own language
as they sway in the strong breezes coming off the Ergothian Plains. The
woods themselves are a wonder of unbroken savagery, teeming with wildlife
and dangerous creatures which have never learned to fear man.

The Ker-Li Wilds [54333] <Inside> 
    The slender pines in this part of the forest are almost identical,
making it difficult to determine which way is which. Only the occasional
glimpse of the granite peaks of the Sentinel Mountains to the north, and
the tiny wooden homes of the Ker-Li nestled along the stony base give
points of reference. The wind in this part of the woods is surprisingly
gentle, whispering like a mother, comforting her child. The smell of pines,
like fresh squeezed juniper, is overwhelming, yet below the woodland
perfume the smell of decay can be detected, faint - yet there nonetheless.

    A strange and unnatural silence has falled onto the pines in this part
of the Ker-Li forest. The skinny evergreens move slowly in a wind that
makes no sound, weaving amongst themselves to create a tapestry af greens
and browns. The needles along the ground are so thick that they absorb the
footsteps of even the most cumbesome traveller, while the uncanny semblance
of the trees in this glade make it impossible to determine which way is
which.

    An ancient altar, decorated with some of the most prized possessions of
the Ker-Li lies hidden in this ancient and foreboding grove. The hides of
black bears hang over the pointed antlers of ancient stags, bleached almost
white by exposure to the elements over unknown eons. There is an ungodly
hush in this part of the forest, almost as if the animals which inhabit the
woods along the Sentinel Mountains know that this is a holy place, and one
that should not be disturbed. Even the faint whisper of the wind between
the pines has been hushed into the sound of silence.

Beyond the Ker-Li Walls [54334] <Inside> 
    A tall, if somewhat flimsy, wooden rampart separates the village of the
Ker-Li from the wild woods which stretched along the base of the Sentinel
Mountains. The rocky soil is too shallow for hardwoods, so the forest
thrives with countless evergreens, reaching their tall, thin trunks into
the vast sky above. The chatter of woodland animals and the thrush of the
birds creates a gentle music which suddenly disappears when larger
predators lurk among the glades. A thick carpet on pine needles, the
detritus of uncounted years, piles up so deep that it seems to swallow the
footsteps.

Ker-Li [54285] <Trail> 
    This part of the Ker-Li tribal home is within a narrow partition of
pine trunks, operating as a sort of rudimentary defensive position in the
unlikely event of an Ergothian attack. Generations ago the Ker-Li made a
series of failed raids on Gulfport, and the ensuing action by the Empire
drove them from their homeland into the lowest mountains of the Sentinel
Peaks. Small single-room wooden houses and cottages with stone floors lie
scattered among the tall pines, bending in the wind.
