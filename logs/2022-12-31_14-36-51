here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    This slight path cuts into the dry plains of Abanasinia like a knife.
Although there are few fresh tracks, the arid landscape keeps this trail
from becoming overgrown with vegetation. Upon a glance, you determine that
most of the tracks were made by unshod horses. A large road can be seen to
the southwest, and the Que-teh village is some distance northeast.

    As you step past the first few tents, Que-teh village takes form.
Numerous tents of varying sizes can be seen in all directions. While on the
surface this village appears to be somewhat permanent, closer inspection
reveals that if desired the Que-teh could easily break camp and move to a
more fertile landscape. To the north lies the exit to Que-teh village,
while to the east and west a circular path winds through the village.

    This well-trod path through Que-teh Village allows easy access to the
few larger and more populated tents of the encampment. It also provides the
major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. There is always someone
wandering around this path, be it the occasional farmer or group of
children playing contentedly. To the north you see the entrance to a very
large tent, possibly the home of the Que-teh tribal leader.

    The avenue twists and turns among the huge vallenwoods. Sounds of life
are all around you. Looking up, you see the sun peeking through the dense
canopy of the forest. As you walk among the forest life, you feel safe and
at ease. You see a large stone building to the east. The avenue continues
to the north and south. A small sign is posted on the stone building.

[36mSouthern Avenue[0;37m
    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a neighboring

solace and divine intervention in a shrine built into a branch. To the
south the bough climbs upward at forty-five degrees, but footholds and

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
