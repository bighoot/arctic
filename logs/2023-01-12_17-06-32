[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the south. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and the gate is placed
between them. The forest to the south looks much wilder and more dangerous
than the forest that houses Solace. Southern Avenue leads north into
Solace itself.

Solace and Haven further to the north. The majestic forests of the fabled
elven capitol of Qualinost deepen to the southwest. If you travel south you
can also come upon Pax Tharkas. If you travel north, you will hit the River

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

[36mInto the Mountain[0;37m
     The small tunnel that opened from above decends rather steeply into
the Garnet Mountains.  Though hard to tell, the tunnel seems to curve
slightly southward. There is nothing but darkness here and it is hard to
travel without bumping your head on the short (even for Gnomes and Dwarves)
ceiling.

[36mInto the City[0;37m
    The tunnel from the overground finally ends its descent and flattens
out. The tunnel gently rolls to the south, where it melds into the dwarven
city of Garnet. Garnet is small city, famous for its mining operations.
Unlike most dwarves, Garnet is eager to help aid the humans to the north
rid the land of the foul dragonarmies.

    A large, underground road slices through the Garnet Mountains here. The
road is more of a large tunnel, carved by the efforts of several thousand
dwarves over a relatively short period of time. Caked in the walls of the
tunnel are several large stones, all glowing and radiating a comfy warmth.
Every so often, then tunnel turns into a small hall, carved with fine
precision and intended to make the road more comfortable to travel. The
halls are relatively short and you are forced to duck in some areas.

greeted with immense waves of heat.  In the center of the room, there is a
large black furnace.  Around the room, there are several racks of forged
weapons waiting to be picked up by the dwarven soldiers.  Though Garnet is
a peaceful nation, it has mobilized for war against the kingdom of Lemish
and the dragon armies. The smith here must work endlessly to put out the
weapons and armor needed to mount such an offensive.  There is no exit,
save for the one you came in.  You are very hot and want to leave.

     A large, underground road slices through the Garnet Mountains here.
The road is more of a large tunnel, carved by the efforts of several
thousand dwarves over a relatively short period of time.  Caked in the
walls of the tunnel are several large stones, all glowing and radiating a
comfy worth. Every so often, then tunnel turns into a small hall, carved
with fine precision and intended to make the road more comfortable to
travel.  The halls and tunnel are relatively short and  you are forced to
duck in some areas.

     The Garnet dwarves, like most other mountain dwarves, value rare and
precious stones.  Gathering them as they continue to expand their
underground kingdom, the gems are brought to the gem-maker here in order to
be polished and, in rare cases, repaired.  This small room basically
consists of a small desk with a large microscope on it.  There is small
cabinet on the western wall, embedded with a few rubies.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    The bough of this vallenwood tree is wide enough to allow ten people to
walk across side by side. You notice a small temple to the east with scores
of people moving in and out, heads bowed. to the west, devout knights seek
solace and divine intervention in a shrine built into a branch. To the
south the bough climbs upward at forty-five degrees, but footholds and
handholds allow for easy progress upwards.

    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a neighboring

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
