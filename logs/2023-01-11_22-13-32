huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

the huge vallenwood trees that cover the Solace Vale. Stretching out to the
north, these fields are known as Nearfields to the citizens of Solace
because of their proximity to the small town. A thick forest of pine trees
lies to the west, beyond which the Crystalmir Lake can be seen. To the east
this dirt trail merges with a wide road.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    The corridor stretches north and south. Heavily barred cells run along
the opposite walls. Every odd interval you come across a torch stuck in the
stone, only to find it long ago burnt out. You wonder if it is purposefully
kept dark down here to further depress the prisoners. The groans and foul
curses of the rowdy prisoners fill your ears. It seems only a lucky few
will ever see the light of day again.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the
tunnel continues into darkness.

source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.

here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

[36mThe End of a Hall[0;37m
    Open doorways lead north and south from here, and a dark wood paneled
hallway runs straight to the east. Taking up a majority of the western wall
is a gate of light brown stone, set into a smooth archway that stands as
tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though
the safest path is anyone's guess.

    Dark wooden panels make up the walls of the two hallways that converge

hallway you can hardly miss a large gate that stands directly at the end of
it, while the southern hallway stops at a flight of stairs that lead up to
a higher floor. The only thing of interest here appears to be a wooden door
leading east.

THE DETECT SKILL
Format: DETECT
    or: DETECT <object>

Mostly learned to enhance thiefy pursuits, such as robbery, this skill
occasionally saves the lives of the thief and their comrades. When using
this skill, the thief has the option where to focus his or her attention.
With no argument, the thief will survey the immediate environment for clues
that a potential trap is nearby - including rooms that will kill on entry.
With an argument, this skill will allow the thief to focus all attention
upon a single object.

Details:
- See above.

    The stone walls here are obscured by black curtains that hang loosely
from the ceiling. Rising up from the floor near the south wall is a
sacrificial altar made of pure silver. Two arms ending in sharp claws
branch out from it's base to hold the sacrifice, and a sharp blade
protrudes in between their grip to thrust through the victim's chest. At
the base of the altar a bowl rests in the gaping maw of a dragon's head
crafted of the same silver, full of blood from the latest human sacrifice
to the goddess Takhisis.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly

here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    Cutting a jagged path along the grassy fields near the sea, this road
follows the coast of the Khurman Sea. The air is filled with the crying of
seagulls and the thick, saline smell of saltwater. It is well traveled by
merchants and sailors, as well as the occasional band of thieves.

    Hot, dry flatlands expand around you. The days in the Alan-Ak Khan are
usually lazy, drifting lazily by into history as the sun beats down. This
crossroad is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and merchants
alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on
the Blood Sea northeast of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder
that bandits frequent these roads.

very few plants other than the occasional cactus dare grow in such a trying

    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of
the mountain above. Complicated gears and pulleys seem to work together in
an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

[36mThe Entrance to Deep Mine[0;37m
    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

[36mThe Entrance to Deep Mine[0;37m
    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

[36mJunction One[0;37m
    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a

unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of

all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the

    Mud puddles line a path, leading directly into the back of a giant
dragon's mouth. A small opening is easily visible between the skull and the

pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem
terrifyingly bigger than the ones seen above. Most of the hoofprints seem
to be leading east, where the mud gets thicker.

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

an unseen source above. The result is an absolutely absurd amount of mud in

different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the

    This tiny alcove is filled with the rich orange-tan mud seen throughout
the den of the armaboros. The bodyprints in this area suggest that it is an
area given mainly to the female beasts. Of course, since the females
congregate in this area, male armaboros, with breeding rights, will come
here to help propagate the species. The room the north appears a little

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

    Fabulous aromas assault the senses from all sides of this compact
kitchen. Over the fire-pit a huge pig is roasting slowly, while at the
stove bread bakes to a fine golden brown. A bookshelf on the southern wall
holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a
priest of Reorx. A window set on the northern wall is open, in the
unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,
while the backdoor of the Burrow is framed near the window.

    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

[36mBefore a Humble Inn[0;37m
    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

    The wide tunnel of the Main Way continues through this much more
residential area of the village. At first glance it appears as the rest of
the main tunnel but little doors in the tunnel, reveal homes dug into the
side walls. Deep treads in the center of the road, indicate the path of the
mining carts to both the west and south. Mounted torches, light this region
from the ceiling down. The way south leads to a junction in the tunnel,
while the way west moves through the residential district.

    In this residential area of Deep Mine, some homes have been dug
directly into the side of the tunnel. Against the western wall, however, a
large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.

[36mThe Golden Lane[0;37m
    While dubbed the 'Golden Lane', this slender tunnel-path hardly passes
as anything greater than an alley. And though completely extravagant, gold
is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

freshly barbequed meat. Here, laughing and happiness seem as common as they

east, and reaches its conclusion to the west.

    Signs of active construction surround the area; hammers and picks
of disparate size lay besides boards of wood and piles of smooth stone
used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious
dwellings dominate the surrounding area, their size accomodated for easily
by the cavernous ceilings overhead. The sounds of banging and shouting
fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the
residents. Judging by the pace the Construction Guild works at, that time
is not far off.

    Smooth white-washed stone walls characterize this spectacular mansion.
The floor is made of fine marble that has been immaculately cleaned,
polished, and glossed. Although there are no furnishings yet, this adds to
the spacious feeling within the mansion. A fine layer of dust coats the
area, as it is not yet visited by anyone outside of the construction guild.
The only real thing of note is the extremely odd contraption set into the
northern wall. Clearly a device of the Engineering Guild, it is unclear at
first glance what it actually does. The mansion can be exited to the east.

[36mThrough the Construction[0;37m
    Signs of active construction surround the area; hammers and picks
of disparate size lay besides boards of wood and piles of smooth stone
used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious
dwellings dominate the surrounding area, their size accomodated for easily
by the cavernous ceilings overhead. The sounds of banging and shouting
fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the
residents. Judging by the pace the Construction Guild works at, that time
is not far off.

This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.

[36mThe Golden Lane[0;37m
    While dubbed the 'Golden Lane', this slender tunnel-path hardly passes
as anything greater than an alley. And though completely extravagant, gold
is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

    In this residential area of Deep Mine, some homes have been dug
directly into the side of the tunnel. Against the western wall, however, a
large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.
Torches set near the ceiling, brighten this residential area.

    The wide tunnel of the Main Way continues through this much more

the main tunnel but little doors in the tunnel, reveal homes dug into the
side walls. Deep treads in the center of the road, indicate the path of the
mining carts to both the west and south. Mounted torches, light this region
from the ceiling down. The way south leads to a junction in the tunnel,
while the way west moves through the residential district.

    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of

an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

keep.

    A sheer and impassable wall of stone lies directly to the west and
east, which slants down into the path on which you walk. If ever there
were a place for an ambush on a caravan, it would be here. The rocky path
continues to the north and appears to level off, while it turns to loose
gravel as it slopes downward just before a cliff ledge.

    The rocky bend in the mountains is a sort of valley as the taller
mountain peaks all around slope downward. Loose boulders above give an
uneasy feeling, as the mountains funnel to this portion of the road. The
only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs
are unscalable. An indication of civilization comes in the form of a thin
netting that sits along the sloped cliffside to the west, preventing much
of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such
netting to the south.

rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there is

    The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

the Solamnic Knighthood, stands just to the side of Westgate pass. The
Knight's Spur, a much more recent addition, stretches out across the
northern exit of the pass, protecting the city of Palanthas that lies
beyond. A few snow-capped peaks of the Vingaard Mountains can be seen in

towering height, stands here, providing an excellent addition to the already
massive tower walls. Small stones rain down from the mountain side, a
possible precursor for things to come. The defenders of the tower can be
heard overhead, marching along the ramparts, ready for battle.

    Looking to the west, a massive stone wall blocks the pass, leaving few
options for movement here. The narrowness of the trail leaves very little
room for maneuvering, and would make a great place for an ambush. The
original highway around the tower has completely fallen apart, the only
remains are several stones in the ground, broken to pieces over time. A
small group of knights can be heard from the ramparts overhead, talking as
they patrol the walls.

    A massive stone wall continues from the tower into the stone face of
the mountain, impeding northbound progress. Moss has begun to grow on the
wall, as upkeep in this area would be a lot of work. A small opening in the
wall appears to have been formed here, leaving just enough room for someone
to pass through. Several sets of footprints, visible in the dirt here, lead
through the opening here, showing that this passage is still traveled.

    The path around the massive walls of the tower is, in reality, little
more than a small goat trail. The Vingaard mountains encroach upon the
walls, leaving just a few feet of clearance between the walls and the stone
face of the mountain. The walls that were added to the tower continue right
into the stone face of the mountain here, completely closing off the path.
Some recent damage to the wall shows here, revealing an opening through the
wall, possibly allowing passage around the tower.

been blocked off by the additions to the towers defensive walls.

     On either side of the path, hidden behind two short trees so they

monument to the left is of a solitary man, his face shrouded by his cloak,
leaning gently on a walking staff. A small owl is perched on his right
shoulder. The monument to the right looks to be a simple block of granite,
but you sense it is more than that. Stepping closer, you see what appear to
be shatter marks in the otherwise pristine stone. Laying atop the granite
block is what appears to be a mold for the blade and hilt of a sword. The
trees and grass here is severely overgrown, making you wonder when the last
time someone was through this area.

side. And there is no sign of the path needing grooming of any kind. Oddly,

impossible to tarnish its unremarkable appearance. To the north you see

positioned on either side of the path.

back to the south since the areas to the east and west are blocked by large

It doesn't take long to realize you are atop a cliff, though its edge is
immediately to the north. You cannot see what lies beyond from where you
are, but it looks to drop off suddenly into a small valley. Although you
feel a sense of wariness, you cannot locate the source of your discomfort
until you realize how quiet it is. Pausing momentarily, you realize there
are no signs or sounds of life anywhere nearby. It's as if all the life in
the area has been swept away by some giant hand.

     As you suspected earlier the cliff drops off into a small valley, but
that supposition couldn't have prepared you for what lies within that
valley. Jutting out from beneath the far wall of the valley is the edge of
a building, made from the same stone as the valley walls. You suspect that
it goes much further into the wall, but can't be sure from this distance.
Lying between you and that building is a large field, which looks as though
a war once raged upon it. There are signs of a barricade to your right, a
rock slide to the left, and various pits and traps in between. With sudden
abruptness you realize you are standing on the cliff the young druid
sacrificed his life upon in a final spell to end the Celestial War. Surely
the building hidden under the valley wall must be the Celestial Temple he
was trying to protect.

decades old battles hangs around you like an oppressive blanket. The ground
beneath your feet is a lifeless color, everything that once grew here
having been crushed into oblivion under soldiers' feet years earlier. As
you shuffle your feet to get a better look around, the dust you kick up

red crystal, at least on this side. As you run your hands along the almost
frictionless surface, you discover that the block turns to granite halfway
along each side. Gazing atop the statue, you see the figure of a large
Aurinite knight, his shield and sword resting against on the ground before
him, staring passionless at the valley wall. There looks to be a second
figure standing back-to-back with the Aurinite, but you can't tell from

made by the body is far too big to be a soldier, even one of their massive

of equipment, weapons, and armour covered with years of dust and decay
litter the floor. None appear to be in any condition that would make them
valuable, even as souvenirs of the war. Judging from the few tracks you can
still see on the ground and the collection of equipment nearby, the battle

     Remarkably this small area of the valley appears to have been spared
the ravages the rest of the valley suffered. There is no debris from
equipment or weapons, no signs of any scuffles, and no bodies within sight.
It immediately seems strange to you that this single area was saved from
the Celestial War, but then you notice the faint marks along the ground.
Upon closer examination, they vaguely resemble the marks a broom with stiff
bristles might leave if it were used to sweep the area. It is with some
hesitation you admit to yourself that somebody deliberately cleaned this
area of the valley, though for what reason you can only guess.

force buried the Celestial Temple beneath the valley walls probably
inadvertently caused this rock slide as well. Though you can travel to the

     The rock slide you saw from the edge of the valley ends here, but it
isn't the mass of stone that captures your attention. This area of the
battle field holds the same signs of the war that plagued the rest of the
valley. There are broken swords, rusted out piece of armour, and various
other pieces of equipment badly in need of repairs. But the war remains
seem deliberately sorted into piles of similar items. Weapons have been
sorted from armour and clothing. By the amount of dust that has collected
on the piles, you guess that whoever did this did so shortly after the war
ended and then left them here unattended.

     Although the rock slide continues to the south here, your attention is

completely cleared of all equipment and weapons that might have been left
from the Celestial War, and the ground has been swept clean. What makes
this area truly spectacular is the single flower someone has planted in the

to the condition it was before the war ravaged it. As you marvel at the
single flower, you notice a dull white fence to the north and beyond it
what appears to be tombstones.

     The rock slide that spilled into the valley obviously started from
this place, but the disaster looks anything but natural. There are clear
signs from this angle of an explosion, apparently from multiple lightning
bolt strikes given the pattern of them. You find that your attention is
drawn away from the rock slide and to the north, though. A large gate made
of white metal stands before you. A sign hangs on the side of the gate, but
it is in a language you do not understand. Looking through the gate and
seeing what's there, you can't help but feel it reads "Cemetery."

wall of the valley. Certainly the small area of the temple you can see is

deep ditch that you could probably climb down into but certainly couldn't
climb back out of because of the ground's loose nature.

Obviously this place is an equipment dump for someone. The question is, why
would anyone gather this unusable equipment in one place? Littering its rim
are stacks of dirt, obviously the ground displaced to dig the pit, and
short stacks of rusted out equipment that have yet to be dumped into it.

     There are two large indentations along the dust covered ground here,
not big enough to be caused by a machine of war, but definitely not
natural. As you lean down to examine them closer, coughing once at the dust
hanging in the air around you, you notice that the grooves are identical in
length and width. You slump your shoulders in concentration, wondering what
could cause such markings, when it suddenly dawns on you. From what you
know of the size of the Gargoyles and Aurinites, they are what would happen
if a soldier who was shoved forcibly into the ground and slid for several
feet, his shoulder blades digging into the ground as he moved.

     The stone block you saw from further away is clearly a monument, but
who originally erected it is a mystery. It appears to made from solid
granite, at least on this side. As you run your hands along the almost
frictionless surface, your discover that the block turns to crystal halfway
along each side. Gazing atop the statue, you see the figure of a large
Gargoyle, his wings spread outward in a battle pose, staring down at you.
There looks to be a second figure standing back-to-back with the Gargoyle,
but you can't tell from this side. Nor can you easily go around the statue

much smaller tracks with three toes and what looks to be a short claw. You

     Cut into the valley walls here are a series of hand and foot holds,
probably meant to serve as a ladder out of the Celestial Valley. There is
what looks to be one complete ladder and two more that look as though they
were begun within the last couple weeks. The indentations in the rock are
too small and too close together for Aurinites or Gargoyles, at least you
believe so from what you know of each race's size. Besides there haven't
been any Gargoyles or Aurinites in the valley for years now. It occurs to
you they were most likely chiseled out by the Fyzians as a way to reenter
the valley without being seen.

     As you scan the valley walls here, you can't help but notice a series
of random and almost frantic grooves cut into the stone to the south. At
first you think they might be someone's failed attempt at a message, but
their grim reality quickly sets in. The grooves can only be from the gloved
hand of a soldier trying desperately to claw his way up the wall and
probably failing miserably. There are no signs of a body or blood, making
you think that whatever finally happened to the soldier, it didn't happen
here. The valley walls prevent you from moving to the south or east, but
the field of battle continues joylessly to the north and west. There
appears to be a stone block immediately north.

begin to weigh heavily in your lungs. The odor of centuries old magic and
decades old battles hangs around you like an oppressive blanket. The ground
beneath your feet is a lifeless color, everything that once grew here
having been crushed into oblivion under soldiers' feet years earlier. As
you shuffle your feet to get a better look around, the dust you kick up
begins to mix with the death in the air. The valley walls block your exit
to the west, but the field of battle continues to the east and north. There

[36mAtop a Small Cliff[0;37m
     The air here seems somewhat fresher than on the other side of the
Celestial Gate, but it is tinged with the scent of wizardry and warcraft.
It doesn't take long to realize you are atop a cliff, though its edge is
immediately to the north. You cannot see what lies beyond from where you
are, but it looks to drop off suddenly into a small valley. Although you
feel a sense of wariness, you cannot locate the source of your discomfort
until you realize how quiet it is. Pausing momentarily, you realize there
are no signs or sounds of life anywhere nearby. It's as if all the life in
the area has been swept away by some giant hand.

     This dirt path is unremarkable in every respect. There are no tracks
of any animals ground into the loose dirt. There are no plants growing
within the confines of the path, though they grow plentifully on either
side. And there is no sign of the path needing grooming of any kind. Oddly,
the path doesn't even need repair after you walk along it, as if it is
impossible to tarnish its unremarkable appearance. To the north you see
what look like two small towers made of granite and crystal, each
positioned on either side of the path.

appears to have been carefully cut through this area and rigorously
maintained over the years. You can't remember when the path began, but you
feel certain it wasn't at the two monuments you can still see to the south.
The sound of a stream is still present in the distant, but most of its
music has been swallowed by the trees around you. The path continues to the

     On either side of the path, hidden behind two short trees so they

monument to the left is of a solitary man, his face shrouded by his cloak,
leaning gently on a walking staff. A small owl is perched on his right
shoulder. The monument to the right looks to be a simple block of granite,
but you sense it is more than that. Stepping closer, you see what appear to
be shatter marks in the otherwise pristine stone. Laying atop the granite
block is what appears to be a mold for the blade and hilt of a sword. The
trees and grass here is severely overgrown, making you wonder when the last
time someone was through this area.

    Directly to the north, the High Clerist Tower rises skyward, reaching

the Solamnic Knighthood, stands just to the side of Westgate pass. The
Knight's Spur, a much more recent addition, stretches out across the
northern exit of the pass, protecting the city of Palanthas that lies

hugging the edges of the mountainsides. The area is fairly rocky, but there
are some small patches of trees here and there, a bit of snow still hanging

to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the

    The plains get vaster as you delve deeper into them. Though mostly
composed of weed, an occasional farmer can be seen tilling the land and
nurturing his crops. Off in the distance, towards the east, thick columns
of smoke rise into the air, giving signs of a recent battle. The road is
hard and well-travelled.

[36mA Highway Through the Plains[0;37m
    Winding its way through the windy and fertile Plains, the highway
stretches to the east and to the west, escaping the horizon. Quiet and
depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the highway, their
heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the
highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and weeds.
The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire. To the
south, a large mountain range rises through the sky. Most of the mountains
appear jagged and snow-capped.

there is still an abundance of flora and fauna, it is noticeably lesser

and, to your shock, a murmur hear and there. The trail separates into many

city of Garnet. Garnet is small city, famous for its mining operations.
Unlike most dwarves, Garnet is eager to help aid the humans to the north

    Due to the impending invasion by Lemish, the dwarves of Garnet have
cautiously barracaded their mines. Huge blocks of granite have been piled
all over the entrance, so that no enemy parties can use the extensive
tunnel system to attack the city. To the north a small platform is set over
a ledge that overlooks nothing in particular. No enemies will be
approaching from that angle, that's for sure.

[36mTunnel to the Palace[0;37m
     Not having a real name, the tunnel that leads from the main part of
Garnet into the palace is rather regal.  Carved into the walls, in between
patches of glowing gems, are statues representing dwarven heroes and kings
of Garnet.  The tunnel is rather large, much taller then the average dwarf.
Over the years, the dwarves here have hosted many diplomatic visitors,
espcially from Palanthas and the High Clerist Tower.  The excavation of the

    A large, underground road slices through the Garnet Mountains here. The
road is more of a large tunnel, carved by the efforts of several thousand
dwarves over a relatively short period of time. Caked in the walls of the
tunnel are several large stones, all glowing and radiating a comfy warmth.
Every so often, then tunnel turns into a small hall, carved with fine
precision and intended to make the road more comfortable to travel. The
halls are relatively short and you are forced to duck in some areas.

     Upon entering this large room carved out from the tunnel, you are
greeted with immense waves of heat.  In the center of the room, there is a
large black furnace.  Around the room, there are several racks of forged
weapons waiting to be picked up by the dwarven soldiers.  Though Garnet is
a peaceful nation, it has mobilized for war against the kingdom of Lemish
and the dragon armies. The smith here must work endlessly to put out the
weapons and armor needed to mount such an offensive.  There is no exit,
save for the one you came in.  You are very hot and want to leave.

     The tunnel opens up into a large rock garden.  The garden is huge and
hypnotic to look at.  Stones of every size and color are lined up in small
rows in between cobblestone paths.  The gardens make a large square, with
all paths eventually reaching the center of the square.  In the center,
there is a large plant, its flowers wide open.  It does appear that
a small stream of sunlight could come in from a hole in the ceiling.
The garden is quite peaceful.

     Not having a real name, the tunnel that leads from the main part of
Garnet into the palace is rather regal.  Carved into the walls, in between
patches of glowing gems, are statues representing dwarven heroes and kings
of Garnet.  The tunnel is rather large, much taller then the average dwarf.
Over the years, the dwarves here have hosted many diplomatic visitors,
espcially from Palanthas and the High Clerist Tower.  The excavation of the
tunnel is flawless in all regards, testiment to the precision  of the
dwarves here.

     At one time, this small tunnel connected to the large network of
tunnels that made up the legendary mines of Garnet.  The King, on his
weekly visits to inspect iron ore and gold production, would decend down a
large stone staircase here.  Unfortunately, the costly war with Lemish and
the fear of invasion somehow from below has forced the dwarves to close
down the entrance. Several boulders and other objects block passage down,
into the mines.

patches of glowing gems, are statues representing dwarven heroes and kings
of Garnet.  The tunnel is rather large, much taller then the average dwarf.
Over the years, the dwarves here have hosted many diplomatic visitors,
espcially from Palanthas and the High Clerist Tower.  The excavation of the
tunnel is flawless in all regards, testiment to the precision  of the
dwarves here. The tunnel climbs downwards, into the palace itself.

Garnet into the palace is rather regal.  Carved into the walls, inbetween
patches of glowing gems, are statues representing dwarven heroes and kings
of Garnet.  The tunnel is rather large, much taller then the average dwarf.
Over the years, the dwarves here have hosted many diplomatic visitors,
espcially from Palanthas and the High Clerist Tower.  The excavation of the
tunnel is flawless in all regards, testiment to the precision  of the
dwarves here.

hypnotic to look at.  Stones of every size and color are lined up in small
rows in between cobblestone paths.  The gardens make a large square, with

there is a large plant, its flowers wide open.  It does appear that
a small stream of sunlight could come in from a hole in the ceiling.

Every so often, then tunnel turns into a small hall, carved with fine

     Branching off from the main road that runs through southern Solamnia,
this small trail slowly ascends upwards as its plunges into the snowy and
rugged Garnet Mountains.  The mountains are said to be the home of the
dwarven nation of Garnet, enemies of the highlord and Lemish.  The
vegetation thins out as you travel away from the plains and into the
mountains.  Occasionally, you spot a few mountain animals here and there.
You hope that these shy creatures are the only ones inhabiting the
snow-topped peaks.

scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,

    This section of the city is like what might be expected in a city of
Vingaard's size. Neither overly lavish nor filthy and run down, it is a
generally pleasant part of town. The houses are small but adequate, running
along the north side of the road opposite the city walls. Just to the west
runs Southern Avenue. A semi-sweet smell can be sensed in the air, that of
melted wax. Looking north, you see a house with a small sign hanging in
front. Upon the sign is a glowing lantern and candle.

    You stand on the southern most road in Vingaard, Southern Perimeter.
The road extends quite a ways to the west and a bit to the east. Along its
length run the city's high walls, towering overhead. Directly north lies
what is possibly the only undeveloped part of Vingaard, a weed-covered
patch of land. Looking eastward you see why. A plume of dark smoke rises up
from the blacksmith, making this a more or less undesirable location. To
the west, many decent homes stand.

[36mSouthern Perimeter Road[0;37m
    You stand on the southern most road in Vingaard, Southern Perimeter.
The road extends quite a ways to the west and a bit to the east. Along its
length run the city's high walls, towering overhead. Directly north lies
what is possibly the only undeveloped part of Vingaard, a weed-covered
patch of land. Looking eastward you see why. A plume of dark smoke rises up
from the blacksmith, making this a more or less undesirable location. To
the west, many decent homes stand.

    The two cobblestone roads of Market and Southern Perimeter intersect
here. The massive stone wall that guards the city stand directly to the
south, rising into the sky above you. A light smell of burning coal can be
sensed coming from the large building to the northeast, which appears to be
Vingaard's primary blacksmith. An open area stands to the northwest
directly across Market Street from the smith. Southern Perimeter stretches
out along the length of the southern wall while Market extends north.

    The acrid scent of burning coal lingers in the air here, a product of
the blacksmith located just to the north. The sound of hammer hitting anvil
rings faintly. The city walls, a predominate feature along the perimeter
roads, stretch out to the west, and to the east where it stops and heads
north. The prevailing northwesterly winds drive the smoke and soot overhead
to the southeast, away from the main parts of the city. A fine layer of
soot covers the cobbles you stand on, leaving chalky black marks on your
boots.

    You stand on the southern most road in Vingaard, Southern Perimeter.
The road extends quite a ways to the west and a bit to the east. Along its
length run the city's high walls, towering overhead. Directly north lies
what is possibly the only undeveloped part of Vingaard, a weed-covered
patch of land. Looking eastward you see why. A plume of dark smoke rises up
from the blacksmith, making this a more or less undesirable location. To
the west, many decent homes stand.

    You stand on the southern most road in Vingaard, Southern Perimeter.
The road extends quite a ways to the west and a bit to the east. Along its
length run the city's high walls, towering overhead. Directly north lies
what is possibly the only undeveloped part of Vingaard, a weed-covered
patch of land. Looking eastward you see why. A plume of dark smoke rises up
from the blacksmith, making this a more or less undesirable location. To
the west, many decent homes stand.

sensed coming from the large building to the northeast, which appears to be
Vingaard's primary blacksmith. An open area stands to the northwest
directly across Market Street from the smith. Southern Perimeter stretches
out along the length of the southern wall while Market extends north.

    The acrid scent of burning coal lingers in the air here, a product of
the blacksmith located just to the north. The sound of hammer hitting anvil
rings faintly. The city walls, a predominate feature along the perimeter
roads, stretch out to the west, and to the east where it stops and heads
north. The prevailing northwesterly winds drive the smoke and soot overhead
to the southeast, away from the main parts of the city. A fine layer of
soot covers the cobbles you stand on, leaving chalky black marks on your
boots.

    The continental weather system that prevails in the Vingaard area
provides a consistent northwestern wind. Because of this, the city's
blacksmith has been built in the southeastern corner of the city, where the
wind blows the soot harmlessly away from the citizens. However, the close
proximity of the smith, just to the northwest, results in a fine haze of
particles in the air, and a dusting of it on the ground. The perimeter
streets stretch both north and west from here, along the walls.

    The cobblestones of Baxtrey Way flow in from the west, mixing with
those of Western Perimeter Road at the base of the town wall. The gray
stones of the wall rise about twenty feet into the air, towering over your
head. To the southwest lies a large stone building with chimneys atop its
roof giving off a black smoke. The smoke can barely be sensed due to the
wind blowing from the northwest. A few houses are visible along the western
side of Eastern Perimeter to the north, while a short distance to the
south, the road ends at the city walls.

    True to its name, this road runs north-south along the eastern edge of
the city. It passes through a mostly residential neighborhood, with many of
the houses very similar in appearance. It seems fairly quiet. Occasionally
a muffled shout can be heard. It seems as though despite the massive wall
separating, some of the noise from the dock work leaks though. A fresh
breeze blows in from the northwest, leaving the air fairly pure save the
mouth-watering scent emanating from a few cooking fires.

    A very faint but sweet smell hangs in the air here. Best identified as
the scent of pastries, you realize that the scent originates from the
bakery just a bit west of here, the smell being carried over by the wind.
The scent adds nicely to the neighborhood, which is fairly plain and simple
but still comfortable. A bit of noise does come in from the north when
Eastern Avenue crosses, as the wares transported to and from the docks pass
by there in wagons.

    The cobblestone lanes of Eastern Perimeter Road and Eastern Avenue
intersect in this residential area of Vingaard. The city walls rise about
twenty feet into the air, towering over your head as they stretch the
length of Eastern Perimeter to the north and south. Few things but houses
are visible as you look up and down Eastern Perimeter. The houses do not
appear to be as expensive as some others in Vingaard, but still look like
very comfortable places to live. Eastern Avenue extends west to the center
of Vingaard, while Eastern Perimeter Road heads north and south.

    Eastern perimeter road runs through what seems to be a middle-class
neighborhood. The houses are made of wood and seem fairly similar in
design. Perhaps they were constructed in a hurry to provide more housing,
but they appear to be well-built and maintained. The great city walls rise
into the sky and run along the road on the eastern side, and a large gate
is visible to the south where Eastern Avenue intersects. A breeze blows in
from the northwest.

    This stretch of Eastern Perimeter is lined with little but houses. Very
few of the houses are two stories tall as most or merely single story
bungalos. For the most part, however, the houses look nice and appear
comfortable to live in. The block seems well maintained, clean, and
generally pretty safe. The cobbles that make up the street are a bit worn
but not terribly, indicating that this is one of Vingaard's less-traveled
roads. A fresh breeze blows, and a deep breath seems quite refreshing.

cobblestones about the size of your fist, all of which fit together
snuggly. Buildings stand on both sides of the road, which a particularly
large one to the north. The stone structure to the north is several stories
tall, and appears to be Vingaard's immense granary. A much smaller, white

businesses stand along Market Street as it extends south, while civic
buildings exist to the north. Vingaard's famed library lies on the west

    A large staircase lies behind a large, wrought iron gate directly to
the north. The smooth marble steps ascend to the entrance of Vingaard's
library. The library itself is constructed of pale gray stones, extends the
length of this block and rises several stories high. To the south stands a
large garden and house behind a large, locked gate. The house, like many
structures in the area, is made of stone. Trees of varying types grow in
its yard, and rustle gently as the wind passes through their leaves.

    You stand in the lobby of Vingaard's library. Rivaled only by the great
library of Palanthas, this immense building holds volumes of ancient texts.
Soft, worn carpeting covers the floor's stone. A large desk stands facing
the front doors, apparently the source of information regarding the
whereabouts of a particular book. Looking east and west, large hallways
branch to smaller ones that pass between the bookcases. The smell of old
and decaying parchment is heavy in the air.

library of Palanthas, this immense building holds volumes of ancient texts.
Soft, worn carpeting covers the floor's stone. A large desk stands facing
the front doors, apparently the source of information regarding the
whereabouts of a particular book. Looking east and west, large hallways
branch to smaller ones that pass between the bookcases. The smell of old

    A large staircase lies behind a large, wrought iron gate directly to
the north. The smooth marble steps ascend to the entrance of Vingaard's
library. The library itself is constructed of pale gray stones, extends the
length of this block and rises several stories high. To the south stands a
large garden and house behind a large, locked gate. The house, like many
structures in the area, is made of stone. Trees of varying types grow in
its yard, and rustle gently as the wind passes through their leaves.

Vingaard. Ground litter that may be expected in larger towns is not present
here. To the north stands an immense structure, spanning the entire length
of this block of Baxtrey. It appears to be Vingaard's famed library. Large
stone columns surround the building, holding up the roof. To the south lies
a much smaller building. A sign hangs above its door, bearing a gleaming
sword. The granary is visible a distance to the east.

roads appear to be quite important, as lampposts line their sides for
illumination during the midnight hours. Various structures housing
businesses stand along Market Street as it extends south, while civic
buildings exist to the north. Vingaard's famed library lies on the west

south side of Baxtrey Way to the west. Market heads north a small distance
to the city walls, as does Baxtrey as it passes east.

    The busy, cobblestone roads of Market and Baxtrey intersect here. Both
roads appear to be quite important, as lampposts line their sides for
illumination during the midnight hours. Various structures housing
businesses stand along Market Street as it extends south, while civic
buildings exist to the north. Vingaard's famed library lies on the west
side, with the granary to the east. Large houses can be seen along the
south side of Baxtrey Way to the west. Market heads north a small distance
to the city walls, as does Baxtrey as it passes east.

    This section of Market Street passes between two large structures. To
the east lies the town's granary. A tall structure comprised of stone
blocks, the granary houses enough food for the citizens of Vingaard to
withstand a very lengthy siege. Several stories tall, the structure
provides an excellent view of the surrounding lands as well. To the west
stands Vingaard's famous library. Stone columns surround its outside,
supporting the massive roof. Market extends south a distance, while it
intersects Northern Perimeter at the base of the city walls just to the

    The continental weather system that prevails in the Vingaard area
provides a consistent northwestern wind. Because of this, the city's
blacksmith has been built in the southeastern corner of the city, where the
wind blows the soot harmlessly away from the citizens. However, the close
proximity of the smith, just to the northwest, results in a fine haze of
particles in the air, and a dusting of it on the ground. The perimeter
streets stretch both north and west from here, along the walls.

Vingaard's primary blacksmith. An open area stands to the northwest
directly across Market Street from the smith. Southern Perimeter stretches
out along the length of the southern wall while Market extends north.

    You stand on the southern most road in Vingaard, Southern Perimeter.
The road extends quite a ways to the west and a bit to the east. Along its
length run the city's high walls, towering overhead. Directly north lies
what is possibly the only undeveloped part of Vingaard, a weed-covered
patch of land. Looking eastward you see why. A plume of dark smoke rises up
from the blacksmith, making this a more or less undesirable location. To
the west, many decent homes stand.

    This area of Vingaard is mostly residential, with houses built fairly
close together. It seems to be a working-class neighborhood, as the houses
are far from opulent but still appear to be quite comfortable for living.
The streets are clean and the air fresh. To the north is a small house with
a small garden. In the garden are several small trees, with a few birds
quietly perching on their branches. Southern perimeter extends along the
city's walls both east and west.

    This section of the city is like what might be expected in a city of
Vingaard's size. Neither overly lavish nor filthy and run down, it is a
generally pleasant part of town. The houses are small but adequate, running
along the north side of the road opposite the city walls. Just to the west
runs Southern Avenue. A semi-sweet smell can be sensed in the air, that of
melted wax. Looking north, you see a house with a small sign hanging in
front. Upon the sign is a glowing lantern and candle.

to the north, at the end of Southern Avenue, the tall gates to Vingaard's
central park are visible. A large archway in the wall leads south to the

    This large tunnel, just behind the keep's gates, travels through the
thick stone walls. The ceiling above you is curved and supported by several
small arches, and two great arches stand on either end of this tunnel where
they lead out into openness. The road's pavement is made of smooth, gray
cobblestones about the size of your fist. Torches mounted on iron brackets
provide almost all of the light for the tunnel. The air seems relatively
stagnant throughout the tunnel, and mixes only with the fresh outside air
at the ends. The cobblestone road heads north into the town of Vingaard,
and south into the surrounding lands of grain.

beyond your vision. A road heads south where it quickly turns and heads
west, passing the toll station as it travels through fields of grain, and a
cobblestone avenue heads north through the gates.

road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,

humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

    The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal
place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,
scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

    A narrow road leads south through the edge of the plains and into a
thick vallenwood forest. An arm of the Kharolis mountains lies to the west
and extends out to the north, the road turns east to lead away from the
mountains on its journey through the plains. The plains of Abanasinia
spread out to the northeast from here and you see another mountain range
off to the east. A thick forest of tall trees can be seen to the south.

in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    The narrow cobbled lane leads east-west towards the main town squares.
Old houses loom above you, casting shadows that dance and seem to follow
your movements. The occasional rat scurries away in your presence. To the
north you see an old well house, possibly the oldest building in this
section of town.

    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

[35mThe Halls of Myth[0;37m
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

[35mThe Forge of Myth[0;37m
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
