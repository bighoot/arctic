[36mThe Reception[0;37m
    The reception contains a small desk. A long hall leads behind the desk
here and you can tell this is where adventurers rest and take time off from
their journeys. A small stairway goes down towards what appears to be a
lively tavern.

    The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace dominates
one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill the
room. A stairway leads up, further into the tree, while another stairway
leads down to the forest below.

[36mA Small Side Street[0;37m
    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

[36mNorthern Avenue[0;37m
    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

[36mSouthern Avenue[0;37m
    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    The giant rock looming over the path is as tall as a vallenwood, and it
must be the biggest boulder on the entire continent. Although its surface
has been methodically eroded by weather, mere nature has done nothing to
diminish its massive size. A narrow path leads off to the east, while the

nature playing tricks on the mind. The unusually flat ground continues and
expands to the west, while a narrow gap between the giant boulders off to
the south allows relatively easy movement in that direction.

justice that govern the whole kingdom of Thorbardin. As the dwarven society
is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the

marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the

the west of here has caved in, and the dwarves haven't repaired it yet. The

is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the

marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. Rubies in

    An enormous anvil of red granite stands on a platform suspended over a
bottomless pit by four arching stone bridges holding it up. The runes of
divinity carved around the base of the anvil clearly indicate that it is an
altar to Reorx. The altar gleams proudly under the light of huge glittering
diamonds embedded in the domed black ceiling to resemble stars, arranged
like the constellations of Paladine and Takhisis circling each other. The
bridges lead off in each of the cardinal directions, but since the southern
part of the hall has caved in, the end of that bridge has been blocked.

[36mSouth Hall of Justice[0;37m
    This great hall is where the royal officers make major decisions about
justice that govern the whole kingdom of Thorbardin. As the dwarven society
is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the
god Reorx, this hall also functions as the dwarves' most holy temple. Giant
marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. A pair of
massive bronze doors guard the entrance to the north, while rubies set into
the ground lead towards the arched bridge to the holy altar to the south.

    The large gate to the south is made of tin and looks extremely flimsy,
to the point that it seems like it might fall over at any time. In fact,
the only thing that seems to be keeping it standing is the immense pile of
garbage heaped against it. A purple miasma of disgusting odors hangs over
the garbage, ready to suffocate anyone who gets too close. A crude sign on
the wall says that this is the entrance to Agharbardin, as if that wasn't
obvious. A wharf lies to the west, and a cart station to the east.

    Smoke and soot belch out of the enormous machine that dominates this
cavern. The machine is a marvel of dwarven engineering, and it drives a
cart and track system for efficiently moving people and goods throughout
the kingdom of Thorbardin. According to a sign carved on the wall, this

[36mThe Southern Wharf[0;37m
    Except for a few snoring gully dwarves napping the among rotting crates
on the east side of the wharf the area is deserted. A purple miasma hangs
over the mound of broken crates, but abruptly stops--almost as if a divine
power erected an invisible wall to block the stench. Contrasting the filthy
east, a broad tunnel opens to the south. A large winch system sits upon
the rocky shore, and thick cables stretch across the Urkhan Sea to guide 
mechanized ferries over the lapping water. The sign here says that ferries 
will take passengers to the Life Tree at the center of the Urkhan Sea.

    Built on the limestone island beneath the Life Tree at the center of
Thorbardin, these docks bustle with activity as dwarves from every clan
pass through on the way to the taverns, forges, and shops housed within. A
large winch system sits upon the rocky shore, and thick cables stretch off

    The gigantic stalactite known as the Life Tree of the Hylar soars up
from here, widening gradually as it rises towards the shadowy ceiling far
above the Urkhan Sea. The outer surface of the stalactite is covered with
an unusual, iridescent coral which casts a warm light that illuminates the
vast cavern surrounding it. Here at its base, the magnificent stalactite
tapers until it is only as wide around as a dwarven waist where it merges
with the limestone island beneath it. A trio of vertical transport shafts
cut through the center of the Life Tree, and the screeching pulleys of the
steam-powered lifts drown out the sounds coming from the nearby docks.

is designed to accommodate the needs of bigger races. Sturdy wooden boards
block movement through the archways in all directions except north.

[36mLevel 10 Lift Station[0;37m
    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a dwarf steps off on
this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must
have fallen off contraptions being transported to other parts of the huge
mountain kingdom. Unlike gnomish parts, these spare parts are as finely
made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

    This large square has been carefully carved out of the limestone, and
it was once a beautiful testament to dwarven stonework. Now, however, the
scratched stone floor is littered with loose gears, broken tools, random
screws and half-finished contraptions. The famed Hylar engineers must work
in the nearby buildings, perfecting the technology that the dwarves use to
defend their mountain home and keep their mighty kingdom running.

    This large square has been carefully carved out of the limestone, and
it was once a beautiful testament to dwarven stonework. Now, however, the
scratched stone floor is littered with loose gears, broken tools, random
screws and half-finished contraptions. The famed Hylar engineers must work
in the nearby buildings, perfecting the technology that the dwarves use to
defend their mountain home and keep their mighty kingdom running.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a dwarf steps off on
this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must
have fallen off contraptions being transported to other parts of the huge
mountain kingdom. Unlike gnomish parts, these spare parts are as finely
made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

the chains in the transport shafts, and almost every single one stops on
this level to drop off a few gruff dwarven commoners. The area is fairly
clean except for some small piles of refuse, as if the garbage collectors
don't come by frequently enough. All of the massive stone archways leading

that remotely exudes wealth is the golden four-post bed, but three of the

    In stark contrast to the excessive opulence of the rest of the home,
this bedroom is both plain and incomplete. The walls are half-painted with
golden veneer, the dresser and chairs are made from cheap pine wood and
the floor is covered with a bedroll instead of a rug. The only furniture
that remotely exudes wealth is the golden four-post bed, but three of the
posts are unfinished. It's as if the owner of the home ran out of money.

    While this enormous grand hall is only slightly less gilded than the
antechamber before it, it is still more opulently decorated than most royal
palaces elsewhere in the world. The owner's taste for platinum and gold is
again on display, this time tempered with mahogany accents that make the
room less blinding to stand in. Besides the antechamber to the west, the
only other exit is a small platinum door on the north side of the hall. It
seems like the owner of this home ran out of money, since there aren't any
doors in the doorways in the gilded walls to the east and south.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a lift stops on this
level so that a well-dressed dwarf or two can step off. The station walls
are lined with platinum and gold panels, suggesting that the dwarves who
live here must be among the wealthiest in Thorbardin. Elaborate carvings
adorn the impressive doors set in the magnificent archways to the east and
south, while the door to the west has been permanently welded shut.

[36mA Gilded Foyer[0;37m
    Although there is gold on almost every available surface in this foyer,
from the walls to the floor to the furniture, the gilding has been done in
a surprisingly tasteful way. The fine home feels expensive, but not overly
extravagant. A cherrywood door has been set in the western wall, and the
magnificent archway to the south leads into a decadent dining hall.

    An enormous dining table carved from a single trunk of cherrywood is
the dominant feature of this large dining hall. An octet of leather and
steel chairs surround the extravagant table, inviting guests to sit down
and indulge in the copious amounts of fatty meat being served. The archway
to the north appears to be the only way out of the dining hall.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and the dwarves who disembark on this
level include representatives from many different clans. The station walls
are adorned with majestic sculptures that tell the stories how all of the
dwarven clans came together to found the mighty nation of Thorbardin. Each
of the four archways is carved in the style and stone of a different clan,
named by the plaques above them: Theiwar, Daewar, Daergar and Klar.

the chains in the transport shafts, and the dwarves who disembark on this
level include representatives from many different clans. The station walls
are adorned with majestic sculptures that tell the stories how all of the
dwarven clans came together to found the mighty nation of Thorbardin. Each
of the four archways is carved in the style and stone of a different clan,
named by the plaques above them: Theiwar, Daewar, Daergar and Klar.

chairs on either side, it seems the thane must prefer to receive his guests
at his table, as equals, rather than from a throne--at least when he's here
in his private residence instead of the Court of Thanes. The walls of the
audience hall are clad in grey granite paneling, and polished granite tiles
cover the floor. A wide hallway to the south leads away from the hall.

Judging from the smells lingering in the air, a dining area must lie to the

[36mSouth Hall of Justice[0;37m
    This great hall is where the royal officers make major decisions about
justice that govern the whole kingdom of Thorbardin. As the dwarven society
is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the
god Reorx, this hall also functions as the dwarves' most holy temple. Giant
marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. The area to
the west of here has caved in, and the dwarves haven't repaired it yet. The
hall continues north, while bronze doors guard the entrance to the east.

there are no cart marks and few bootprints, even if the smooth area seems
unnaturally wide and the cliff formed by the mountain meeting the ground is
perfectly vertical. The unusually flat ground narrows a bit as it continues

    To the north is a sheer drop off the side of the mountain. High winds
threaten to blow you off the side of the mountain and you quickly realize
that, even flying, your chances of surviving a step off the cliff would be
minimal. To the south, a small path between the keep and some boulders back
towards the main gate of the keep. Off to the west, a small ledge winds its
way between the keep walls and a sheer drop-off. It might be safe to go
that way, but you wonder if you should risk it. To the east, the winding
road leads down the mountain.

travellers passing through these parts. In some spots the bog has reclaimed
the land that once belonged to it. Foothills can be seen to the west and
north directions. To the north the foothills slowly give way to the plains
of Dergoth. The raised road through the bog leads to the north and east
from here.

Inn of the Last Home in Solace and the streets of Haven are welcome spots
for the tired traveller. To the south, cold weather prevails as the chilly

[36mCrossing the River White-Rage[0;37m
    Looking around as you cross the immense stone bridge, you gaze in awe
at a pair of huge pillars of stone. The pillars seem to be the main
foundation of the structure, keeping it a safe distance from the raging
waters below. Even from here, you can hear the roar from the river below as
it crashes into the pillars and is forced around them. The stone bridge
stretches northward, high above the river, but the southern bank is still
reassuringly nearby.

     You stand at the south end of a mighty stone bridge.  Below, a very
large and swift flowing river roars down towards the New Sea.  The river
is quite dangerous and only the largest of ferries are capable of being
able to properly navigate it.  The bridge itself is wide and is one of
the most impressive feats of dwarven craftsmanship that you have ever
seen.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    The yellowish sands seamlessly slope into the waters of Newsea as the
waters ebb and flow along the shoreline. The sounds of the sea rhythmically
wash alongst the shore, offering a consistent melody. The caw of sea birds
can be heard before they are seen, taking off and landing atop the waters
to the west. The sandy beach leads eastwards and comes to a trailhead,
leading through some verdant rolling hills. The sky is partially cloudy,
and a drizzle of rain can be felt from time to time.

    The trail descends rapidly, the end of which can be seen leading to a
sandy shoreline. The waters of Newsea can be seen rushing onto the shore,
staining the sand with moisture. Far to the southeast, beyond the hills,
the terrain opens up into a vast desert known as the Plains of Dust. There
is almost a distinguishable line where the sands from the plains meets the
grass at the edge of the hills. The sun warms the hills, but some light
gray rain clouds can be seen moving in from the west.

green grass. Far to the south, beyond the hills, the terrain opens up into
a vast desert known as the Plains of Dust. There is almost a

    Far to the north, the green foothills give way to a massive wetlands
known as Sables Swamp. There is no visible path from here, and access to the
swamp must be granted from some other direction. Further still is the
southern edge of the Khalkists known as Onyx Teeth. Somewhere between the
two lies the ruins of Brukt, a long since destroyed ogre town. The green
hills continue all around, but a trail can be followed which runs east,
west, and south.

a vast desert known as the Plains of Dust. There is almost a

    A shady grove offers a cool place to rest at this intersection. The
rolling grasslands to the south extend beyond sight, running parallel to
the forest of Silvanesti. The southern tip of the Khalkist mountains lies a
great distance towards the west, and rise up like towering giants. Beyond
that, though not visible, lies the waters of New Sea. Ogre Peaks and Onyx
Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name
suggests, is home to many ogres. The land to the north is a mighty plain
known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.
Skirting the northern tip of the Silvanesti forest, the road continues east
into the lands of Khur.

    The beating sun bakes the dirt road in such heat that the road has
cracked into what almost resembles cobblestones. Insects scurry across,
careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only

    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

clearing is a huge vallenwood. Looking up into the vallenwood, you spy what
looks like a small shop. A stairway spirals down around the trunk, reaching
the ground right before you. Northern Avenue is visible to your west. A
small sign is posted next to the stairway.

lies Solace and the lands of the elves. You strain to see that far, knowing
in your heart that it's impossible.

stretches to the north and to the south, escaping the horizon. Quiet and
depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the highway, their
heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the
highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and weeds.
The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire. A small

    The pristine cobblestones of Kharas Avenue that were the trademark of
Lytburg are mirrored here, yet so worn and aged it's hard to believe they
are actually part of the same town. The grit of battle and preparation have
stinted the beauty of the side streets and back alleys that have been
neglected by haste and negligence. Away from the bustling marketplace, this
is the first indication that all is not well in the town of Lytburg.

    The marketplace continues here, strangely overcrowded for a city
besieged, although that may have something to do with its placement, having
a mountain range flanking its gates. To the north and south, throngs of
people crowd the stalls, shouting to be heard over their neighbors.

better than running off to battle in nothing better than smallclothes,
however, and conscripts vye for even the poorest specimen the "craftsmen"

    Leatherworkers and armourers work side by side, frantically patching
chainmail that is horrifyingly and obviously second-hand. How they acquire
their raw materials is hardly a mystery as you note bloodstains and bits of

better than running off to battle in nothing better than smallclothes,
however, and conscripts vye for even the poorest specimen the "craftsmen"
have to offer.

defeated and hopeless.

    Before you stand the eastern gates of the city, besieged and
battleworn. Soldiers hustle to and fro trying desperately to prevent the
total collapse into anarchy. It's almost impossible to imagine how the town
has not been evacuated as you evaluate the puny defenses. The gates are
flanked by watchtowers inside which lone sentries stare bleakly east,
defeated and hopeless.

    The bough of this vallenwood narrows as it extends further south. A

footholds and handholds in the bough leading down.

    This magic shop is an old and dusty place. Shelves and cases line the
walls and fill the room. Scrolls, books, wands, staves, and all sorts of
magical paraphernalia is on display. The shades on the windows let in stray
rays of light which streak through the dust filled air, making slashes
across the dim room. A faint smell of incense fills the air and you hear
chimes tinkling in the distance. A set of spiral staircase carved into the
tree leads down. The center of the tree can be accessed through a door to
the west.

    This clearing is set off from the main road. The lush undergrowth of
the forest forms a living boundary around its edges. In the center of the
clearing is a huge vallenwood. Looking up into the vallenwood, you spy what
looks like a small shop. A stairway spirals down around the trunk, reaching
the ground right before you. Northern Avenue is visible to your west. A
small sign is posted next to the stairway.
