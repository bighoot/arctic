    A row of heavy fortifications are arranged facing the southern wall,
designed to protect dwarven warriors in case invaders are somehow able to
break through the giant stone plug known as Southgate. Any invading forces
resilient enough to make it past the first line of defenses will be forced
to suddenly turn right, which makes fighting very awkward for right-handed
fighters, to ascend the huge spiral ramp that leads into Thorbardin.

to accommodate merchant carts. A few murder holes are hidden in the wall to
aid in repelling would-be attackers foolish to attempt an invasion.

    Depending on which direction you're traveling, this is either the end
or the beginning of the Sixteenth Road. The Road is paved with cobbelstones
of pink granite that merge seamlessly into a giant, arching stone bridge
that spans the yawning chasm to the north. The south end of the road slopes
down and turns abruptly to wind down a huge spiral ramp. There is also a
small side street to the east which leads to a residential area.

occupant is neither extravagantly rich nor wretchedly poor, so the simple
furniture is well-made and functional, but not ornate. The house is very

divinity carved around the base of the anvil clearly indicate that it is an
altar to Reorx. The altar gleams proudly under the light of huge glittering
diamonds embedded in the domed black ceiling to resemble stars, arranged
like the constellations of Paladine and Takhisis circling each other. The
bridges lead off in each of the cardinal directions, but since the southern
part of the hall has caved in, the end of that bridge has been blocked.

resilient enough to make it past the first line of defenses will be forced
to suddenly turn right, which makes fighting very awkward for right-handed
fighters, to ascend the huge spiral ramp that leads into Thorbardin.

of this region. The bog can be seen in all directions from here, the only

Dergoth. The eastern arm of the Kharolis mountains can be seen far off to

    This narrow, dirt road winds its way through the great forest, curving
around large trees and rocks. You can hear the chattering of hundreds of
animals all around you, and a few of the trees seem to have large claw
marks. To the south, lies the northern gate of Solace, and to the north,
the road continues. Large bushes block your view to the east and west.

[35mThe Inn of Myth[0;37m
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    There is a fair-size clearing here, but as you look north and west, you
see the passageways are much tighter. To the north, there is a passage
between the walls of the mountain and a bunch of boulders and rubble piled
high. Westward, a small path winds its way into the depths of the Kharolis
Mountains, passing between a mountainside and jagged cliffs. To the south,
a steep, but usable path leads down to the road near Tarsis.

    This small passageway winds its way between the boulders at the foot
of the mountain to the north and the sheer face of a cliff looming above
you to the south. The passage is small, but looks fairly easy traveled for
quite a ways. Both to the east and the west, the passage continues.

    Cleverly hidden from prying eyes, this narrow path winds its way
amongst massive boulders of basalt and granite. The shrubs separating this
path from the one to the south are mounted on a hinge, making it easy to
slip out undetected. The path ascends slowly as it bends to the west.

    The giant rock looming over the path is as tall as a vallenwood, and it
must be the biggest boulder on the entire continent. Although its surface
has been methodically eroded by weather, mere nature has done nothing to
diminish its massive size. A narrow path leads off to the east, while the
foot of an impossibly tall mountain lies a few steps to the north.

    The ground here at the foot of the mountain is unnaturally smooth,
almost as if the rock was hewn flat to ease the passage of trade carts. Of
course, there are no cart marks and few bootprints, so perhaps it's just
nature playing tricks on the mind. The unusually flat ground continues and
expands to the west, while a narrow gap between the giant boulders off to
the south allows relatively easy movement in that direction.

    A row of heavy fortifications are arranged facing the southern wall,
designed to protect dwarven warriors in case invaders are somehow able to
break through the giant stone plug known as Southgate. Any invading forces
resilient enough to make it past the first line of defenses will be forced
to suddenly turn right, which makes fighting very awkward for right-handed
fighters, to ascend the huge spiral ramp that leads into Thorbardin.

    This great hall is where the royal officers make major decisions about
justice that govern the whole kingdom of Thorbardin. As the dwarven society
is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the
god Reorx, this hall also functions as the dwarves' most holy temple. Giant
marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. The massive
hall continues south and west and the sign hanging on the locked gate to
the giant lift in the eastern wall says it is for official use only.

    Except for a few snoring gully dwarves napping the among rotting crates
on the east side of the wharf the area is deserted. A purple miasma hangs
over the mound of broken crates, but abruptly stops--almost as if a divine
power erected an invisible wall to block the stench. Contrasting the filthy
east, a broad tunnel opens to the south. A large winch system sits upon
the rocky shore, and thick cables stretch across the Urkhan Sea to guide 
mechanized ferries over the lapping water. The sign here says that ferries 
will take passengers to the Life Tree at the center of the Urkhan Sea.

the only thing that seems to be keeping it standing is the immense pile of
garbage heaped against it. A purple miasma of disgusting odors hangs over
the garbage, ready to suffocate anyone who gets too close. A crude sign on
the wall says that this is the entrance to Agharbardin, as if that wasn't
obvious. A wharf lies to the west, and a cart station to the east.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a dwarf steps off on
this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must
have fallen off contraptions being transported to other parts of the huge
mountain kingdom. Unlike gnomish parts, these spare parts are as finely
made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

    This large square has been carefully carved out of the limestone, and
it was once a beautiful testament to dwarven stonework. Now, however, the
scratched stone floor is littered with loose gears, broken tools, random
screws and half-finished contraptions. The famed Hylar engineers must work
in the nearby buildings, perfecting the technology that the dwarves use to
defend their mountain home and keep their mighty kingdom running.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a dwarf steps off on
this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must
have fallen off contraptions being transported to other parts of the huge
mountain kingdom. Unlike gnomish parts, these spare parts are as finely
made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

this level to drop off a few gruff dwarven commoners. The area is fairly
clean except for some small piles of refuse, as if the garbage collectors
don't come by frequently enough. All of the massive stone archways leading
away from the lift station are plain and unadorned, but the archway to the
south appears to have been recently and permanently boarded up.

given the race's reputation for drinking and the infamy of their signature

get dingy, but is otherwise a serviceable place to get a stiff drink.

    While one might think the taverns of dwarves to be fine establishments
given the race's reputation for drinking and the infamy of their signature
beverage, most of them are actually pretty simple watering holes like this
one. Since this tavern isn't frequented very much anymore, it's started to
get dingy, but is otherwise a serviceable place to get a stiff drink.

given the race's reputation for drinking and the infamy of their signature
beverage, most of them are actually pretty simple watering holes like this
one. Since this tavern isn't frequented very much anymore, it's started to
get dingy, but is otherwise a serviceable place to get a stiff drink.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone

the chains in the transport shafts, and almost every single one stops on
this level to drop off a few gruff dwarven commoners. The area is fairly
clean except for some small piles of refuse, as if the garbage collectors
don't come by frequently enough. All of the massive stone archways leading
away from the lift station are plain and unadorned, but the archway to the

    While this enormous grand hall is only slightly less gilded than the
antechamber before it, it is still more opulently decorated than most royal
palaces elsewhere in the world. The owner's taste for platinum and gold is
again on display, this time tempered with mahogany accents that make the
room less blinding to stand in. Besides the antechamber to the west, the
only other exit is a small platinum door on the north side of the hall. It
seems like the owner of this home ran out of money, since there aren't any
doors in the doorways in the gilded walls to the east and south.

    While this enormous grand hall is only slightly less gilded than the
antechamber before it, it is still more opulently decorated than most royal
palaces elsewhere in the world. The owner's taste for platinum and gold is
again on display, this time tempered with mahogany accents that make the
room less blinding to stand in. Besides the antechamber to the west, the
only other exit is a small platinum door on the north side of the hall. It
seems like the owner of this home ran out of money, since there aren't any
doors in the doorways in the gilded walls to the east and south.

    In stark contrast to the excessive opulence of the rest of the home,
this bedroom is both plain and incomplete. The walls are half-painted with
golden veneer, the dresser and chairs are made from cheap pine wood and
the floor is covered with a bedroll instead of a rug. The only furniture
that remotely exudes wealth is the golden four-post bed, but three of the
posts are unfinished. It's as if the owner of the home ran out of money.

    While this enormous grand hall is only slightly less gilded than the
antechamber before it, it is still more opulently decorated than most royal
palaces elsewhere in the world. The owner's taste for platinum and gold is
again on display, this time tempered with mahogany accents that make the
room less blinding to stand in. Besides the antechamber to the west, the
only other exit is a small platinum door on the north side of the hall. It
seems like the owner of this home ran out of money, since there aren't any
doors in the doorways in the gilded walls to the east and south.

are lined with platinum and gold panels, suggesting that the dwarves who

the chains in the transport shafts, and the dwarves who disembark on this

are adorned with majestic sculptures that tell the stories how all of the
dwarven clans came together to found the mighty nation of Thorbardin. Each
of the four archways is carved in the style and stone of a different clan,
named by the plaques above them: Theiwar, Daewar, Daergar and Klar.

    Striking the perfect balance between wildly overgrown and meticulously
cultivated, this garden of mushrooms is a beautiful, psychedelic feast for
the eyes. There is such variety here that it seems like every species of
fungus on the planet--from massive mushrooms to tiny toadstools--is somehow
represented here. The mushrooms grow so thickly, the only way to know where
the garden continues is to try pushing through the wall of fungus.

into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

You lift up the mattress, finding a hole underneath. With a bit of hesitation
you descend into the hole, stepping onto a ladder below and into an
underground tunnel.
It is pitch black.

[36mBefore a Gate[0;37m
    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

[36mThe End of a Hall[0;37m
    Open doorways lead north and south from here, and a dark wood paneled
hallway runs straight to the east. Taking up a majority of the western wall
is a gate of light brown stone, set into a smooth archway that stands as
tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though
the safest path is anyone's guess.

[36mIntersecting Halls[0;37m
    Dark wooden panels make up the walls of the two hallways that converge
here, and dirt trails the floor following them both. Down the western
hallway you can hardly miss a large gate that stands directly at the end of
it, while the southern hallway stops at a flight of stairs that lead up to
a higher floor. The only thing of interest here appears to be a wooden door
leading east.

[36mThe End of a Hall[0;37m
    Oaken panels stained dark line the sides of the hall, and also end it
in a solid wall to the south. From here you can access the floor above
this, what would be ground level in this subterranean building, by a flight
of stairs against the southern wall. Though you can't see into it very well
from here, you can feel the breeze of freshly circulated air from the room
above, a welcome change from the stagnant and stale air of these
underground halls. To the north the hallway you are in, meets up with
another hallway running east-west.

    Fresh air wafts in through an open window south, set within a stone
wall. Leading back down to the basement floor is a flight of stairs, and to
the north the hall continues on to a broad intersection. The east and west
walls hold a leaking wax candle each, keeping this area lit throughout the
night though they do little to heat the cold stone walls.

fatigued from long hours of training in the lower floors. Lumpy bunks
covered in wiry grey sheets stand stacked closed together, almost rising up
to the ceiling. Small footlockers are wedged underneath the bottom bunks,
containing the recruits' only worldly possessions. The line of cots runs
east and south from here, where more recruits doze peacefully.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

    The rocky bend in the mountains is a sort of valley as the taller
mountain peaks all around slope downward. Loose boulders above give an
uneasy feeling, as the mountains funnel to this portion of the road. The
only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs
are unscalable. An indication of civilization comes in the form of a thin
netting that sits along the sloped cliffside to the west, preventing much
of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such
netting to the south.

trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard

a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands

    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge

grain can be seen. The pine-covered trail follows the shoreline to the
south into thicker woods and north.

at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    A few sleeping recruits pay little attention to your being here,
fatigued from long hours of training in the lower floors. Lumpy bunks
covered in wiry grey sheets stand stacked closed together, almost rising up
to the ceiling. Small footlockers are wedged underneath the bottom bunks,
containing the recruits' only worldly possessions. The line of cots runs
east and south from here, where more recruits doze peacefully.

    Standing before double doors carved with the two common visages of
Takhisis, you are immediately struck by a powerful evil aura. Stone walls
meet up with a curved ceiling, and lead westward through a twisting
passage, while to the east the foreboding doors of a temple to the dark
goddess lie before you. Clearly the coward's way is to flee west away from
the danger within, though those who wish to follow in the footsteps of
heroes would surely brave on to the dangers of the temple.

in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

the road leads into the plains. Looking south you can see forested

southeast.

    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

the road continues. Large bushes block your view to the east and west.

but not as many as to the south. The road runs in the near shadows of the
Kharolis mountains which can be seen off to the west, beyond a great lake.
The mountains appear to run north for some distance before ending. The

lies to the west, beyond which the Crystalmir Lake can be seen. To the east
this dirt trail merges with a wide road.

are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,

well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
