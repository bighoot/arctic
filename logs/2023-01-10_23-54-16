Welcome to the land of Krynn.

    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,

well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    A narrow road leads deep into a thick forest of very tall trees and

but not as many as to the south. The road runs in the near shadows of the
Kharolis mountains which can be seen off to the west, beyond a great lake.
The mountains appear to run north for some distance before ending. The
plains spread out to the north from here for many leagues.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge

the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    The Old Road is intersected here by the cobblestone road leading to the
small fishing community, Newport. Beyond Newport is a bay of the New Sea,
its waters stretching out across the horizon. The cobblestone continues to
the north, signifying the beginnings of a major trade route to the towns of
Solace and Haven further to the north. The majestic forests of the fabled
elven capitol of Qualinost deepen to the southwest. If you travel south you
can also come upon Pax Tharkas. If you travel north, you will hit the River
White Rage.

that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and

in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.

    Narrow isles lead in between the wooden pews from north to south,
heading up to the base of an altar dedicated to Takhisis, which takes up
the entire southern wall of this wide room. Light tan pallets of woven hemp
line the rows of pews from east to west, upon which Takhisis's acolytes
kneel to offer her dark prayers. Leading west is an entryway into a
hallway, occupied by two black wooden doors, one bearing a carving of a
beautiful woman and the other a hideous dragon with five heads.

branch out from it's base to hold the sacrifice, and a sharp blade
protrudes in between their grip to thrust through the victim's chest. At

of a dragon with five heads, standing upon a dais. Pews run across the room
parallel to the altar of Takhisis, supplying clerics of the evil goddess
with a place to worship. In between pews, hemp pallets stretch the length
of the room for devotees to kneel in the presence of their deity.

    The stone walls here are obscured by black curtains that hang loosely
from the ceiling. Rising up from the floor near the south wall is a
sacrificial altar made of pure silver. Two arms ending in sharp claws
branch out from it's base to hold the sacrifice, and a sharp blade
protrudes in between their grip to thrust through the victim's chest. At
the base of the altar a bowl rests in the gaping maw of a dragon's head
crafted of the same silver, full of blood from the latest human sacrifice
to the goddess Takhisis.

    The stone walls here are obscured by black curtains that hang loosely

branch out from it's base to hold the sacrifice, and a sharp blade

to speak his last words. "I came here... with two more... free them from the

lose their focus and his head drops silently to his chest. Reaching into his

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the

near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

[36mA Path in the Plains of Abanasinia[0;37m
    This slight path cuts into the dry plains of Abanasinia like a knife.
Although there are few fresh tracks, the arid landscape keeps this trail
from becoming overgrown with vegetation. Upon a glance, you determine that
most of the tracks were made by unshod horses. A large road can be seen to
the southwest, and the Que-teh village is some distance northeast.

this path increase noticeably. Wildlife here is abundant for the plains,
perhaps the reason for choosing this location as the most recent campground
of the Que-teh plainsmen. The Que-teh village is still quite a distance to
the north, while to the south you can still barely make out the road

reveals that if desired the Que-teh could easily break camp and move to a
more fertile landscape. To the north lies the exit to Que-teh village,

sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors

scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands

    The vast mercantile district of Jelek can be heard over the walls to
the east. The shouts of slavers and mercenaries give testament to the cruel
control that the Blue Dragonarmy has exerted over the crumbling city. The
road reaches a path to the north gates just to your north, continuing
towards the peaks of the Khalkists. Out to the west, the foothills cover
the badlands, leaving no sign of habitation in their midst.

    The decaying city of Jelek, just over the walls to the east, is filled
with the cries of slavers and mercenaries moving their slaves about. The
citizenry quickly hurries past, careful to avoid the gaze of the dragonarmy
and the slavers. The buildings are made of roughly hewn stone and clay,
hardly any timber can be seen on the buildings.

    The mercantile town of Jelek sprawls out to the northeast, various
stone buildings and slaver tents rise above the low protective wall that
circles the city. The road widens to the east and west, while winding next
to the crumbling walls to the north. East, the road leads through a pass in
the Khalkists towards Neraka. West, the way looks less traveled, leading
off through the badlands to the lands of Throt beyond.

pretty much straight down, zigzagging down a path literally cut out of the
rock. To the west it stays level a bit, but promises a similar descent.

the carnage of war. The air is filled with a thick film, possibly coming

    The thick bushes and shrubs that dominate this area have been cleared
away slightly to create this small campsite, which is extremely well hidden
amongst the thick flora growing around it. The distant sounds of heavy
marching and violent combat still echo through the air from the White
Dragonarmy training camp nearby, though the noise is somewhat dampened by
the thick foliage. A large brown log rests on the sandy ground in the
centre of the area just a few feet from a small campfire, which although it
does not provide as much heat as one might desire cannot be any bigger, or
it would risk drawing attention to the existance of this hidden sanctuary.

    Dozens of flat black stones have been laid into the dusty ground here,
creating a makeshift stone path which connects the building to the north
with the main training grounds. Large bushes of thick green foliage grow on
either side of the pathway which seem to dampen the noise coming from the
training ground, making this area quieter than the rest of the camp. Dusty
footprints lead to and from the stone building that stands directly to the
north, as though whomever resides there has regular visitors.

    Thick dust covers the floor of the training grounds which swirls
through the air when it is kicked up by dragonarmy recruits honing their
combat skills. Wooden training dummies crafted to loosely resemble a
humanoid figure are scattered through the area, covered with large notches
and gouges where metal weapons have bit deep into their timber. Marring the
dust covered ground are a few splashes of crimson, most likely dried blood
that was spilt during heated sparring sessions. The dusty training grounds
continues to extend outwards to the east and south, while the other
directions lead to quieter areas of the camp.

    Grey dirt has been heavily compacted here to form a sandy path that
leads from the dusty training grounds where the recruits hone their battle
skills to a large stone building directly north of here. Tall banners of
pitch black cloth hang over the walls of the building emblazoned with the
snow white insignia of the White Dragonarmy. The stone building is well
constructed and made from thick stone, having been clearly designed as a
well fortified structure that can be used as a defensive position should
the training camp come under siege. Clouds of dust are occasionally blown
through the area, carried in from the dusty training grounds to the east by
gusts of wind that ebb and flow.

the truth. Large maps of Solamnia, Palanthas and Vingaard are spread across
the stone walls of the chamber which have numerous small pins placed in
them, presumably marking specific strategic locations. Set up in the
western half of the room is a massive desk of solid ironwood complete with
a wooden chair where the leader of this camp presumably completes any
administrative work that is required, though the build up of paperwork
suggest those duties are often neglected. Two small green potted plants
rest in the corners of the room which provide some colour and vibrancy to
the room, breathing a wisp of life into the otherwise dull environment.

    Although structurally well built, this entrance hall lacks any finesse
or fashion. The walls are completely bare stone, there is no furniture
within eyeshot and the floor has been made of plain oaken floorboards. The
White Dragonarmy's leadership is obviously more concerned with devoting
their resources to their war effort rather than luxury. Corridors to the
north and east lead to other areas of the officers' mess, whilst a pair of
thick ironwood doors are fixed in the western wall.

    This pristine kitchen sparkles with cleanliness, starkly contrasting
the grimey officers' dining hall that lies just beyond the door. Long
benches of polished grey stone run around the edges of the room and various
types of shiny steel pots and cooking utensils cover their surfaces, all of
which are arranged in a meticulously organised manner. Hundreds of
different spices and seasonings stand in a line along the western wall next
to a monstrous mortar and pestle (quest?) that looks far too heavy to carry.
Whomever runs this kitchen clearly takes their job very seriously, as it is
quite possibly the most spotless cooking area in the entirety of Krynn.

    This pristine kitchen sparkles with cleanliness, starkly contrasting
the grimey officers' dining hall that lies just beyond the door. Long
benches of polished grey stone run around the edges of the room and various
types of shiny steel pots and cooking utensils cover their surfaces, all of
which are arranged in a meticulously organised manner. Hundreds of
different spices and seasonings stand in a line along the western wall next
to a monstrous mortar and pestle (quest?) that looks far too heavy to carry.

quite possibly the most spotless cooking area in the entirety of Krynn.

    Long tables of polished oak fill this hall where the officers of the
White Dragonarmy come to savour brief moments of enjoyment as they devour
their meals. Each of the tables dominating the centre of the room is
flanked by two long oaken benches to provide seating arrangements for those
eating here. Dozens of empty plates and bowls scatter the tables, as it
seems more time is spent eating meals rather than cleaning up afterwards.
Dim light flickers through the room emanating from a candle bearing
chandelier that hangs gently from the ceiling and the room is filled with
the delicious aromas of gourmet food that seem to be coming from nearby.

White Dragonarmy's leadership is obviously more concerned with devoting
their resources to their war effort rather than luxury. Corridors to the

    Grey dirt has been heavily compacted here to form a sandy path that
leads from the dusty training grounds where the recruits hone their battle
skills to a large stone building directly north of here. Tall banners of
pitch black cloth hang over the walls of the building emblazoned with the
snow white insignia of the White Dragonarmy. The stone building is well
constructed and made from thick stone, having been clearly designed as a
well fortified structure that can be used as a defensive position should
the training camp come under siege. Clouds of dust are occasionally blown
through the area, carried in from the dusty training grounds to the east by
gusts of wind that ebb and flow.

combat skills. Wooden training dummies crafted to loosely resemble a
humanoid figure are scattered through the area, covered with large notches
and gouges where metal weapons have bit deep into their timber. Marring the

that was spilt during heated sparring sessions. The dusty training grounds

be built within the camp's boundaries but the majority of the grounds seem
to be occupied by a central training area. An opening in the thick steel

charts and other documents that the Red Dragonarmy commanders would be
using when having meetings around this table. A well carved bed sits on the
western wall of the tent and has a steel chest that is locked tight at its
foot. Large tapestries cover all the walls making the memory of what the

All around the sound of weapons and armor clanging together can be heard as

    The avenue continues to wind north and south through the dense forest
town. The sounds of wildlife abound here, making you feel safe and at
ease. It is almost as if this town has been built in a special place. It
is possible to leave the avenue and venture west here.

    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    You are at the corner of a large lake, which fills your vision far to
the west before ending at high, jagged cliffs. The forest of pine that this
trail winds through thins out to the north and east, where large fields of
grain can be seen. The pine-covered trail follows the shoreline to the
south into thicker woods and north.

the path leads into it. You can see a large lake off in the south and high
jagged cliffs off to the west.

[35mThe Halls of Myth[0;37m
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

[35mThe Alchemy Lab of Myth[0;37m
    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

    You stand in a high-domed room with a black marble floor. At its center,
stairs lead up to a circular pedestal with a massive portal framed by shiny
bronze beams. The surface of the portal swirls slowly in a hypnotic pattern,
inviting you to touch it.

[35mThe Halls of Myth[0;37m
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
