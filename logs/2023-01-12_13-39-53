The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    The road travels through the mountains, this is the western edge of the
Kharolis mountains. The air is thin here and you have to gasp for breath to
keep on moving. You don't see much vegetation around, as you would expect
in a mountain region.

remove this pass from Krynn. Rocks are strewn about, they appear to have
fallen off of the mountains on both sides of you.

towards the main gate of the keep. Off to the west, a small ledge winds its
way between the keep walls and a sheer drop-off. It might be safe to go
that way, but you wonder if you should risk it. To the east, the winding
road leads down the mountain.

    Before you stand two huge brass gates which once guarded the entrance
to Thorbardin. However, a terrible earthquake has caused the passageway
beyond the gates to collapse, sealing off the entrance forever. The giant
gates have fallen off their hinges and lean forlornly against the piles of
rubble. Although the passage into the kingdom is destroyed, the indomitable
mountain known as Cloudseeker still stands, reaching towards the sky. To
the north and south, narrow paths lead around the cliffs surrounding the
mountain, and a sloping path to the east leads back down the mountain.

    The passage way between the mountain walls and the piles of boulders
is just wide enough for a fair-size adventuring party to pass through. The
boulders look unsteady and you would hate to have to climb up on them, but
thankfully don't look like there will be an avalanche. To the north, the

the tight passageway continues through the barren mountain range.

high. Westward, a small path winds its way into the depths of the Kharolis
Mountains, passing between a mountainside and jagged cliffs. To the south,
a steep, but usable path leads down to the road near Tarsis.

nature playing tricks on the mind. The unusually flat ground continues and
expands to the west, while a narrow gap between the giant boulders off to
the south allows relatively easy movement in that direction.

    This steep spiral ramp revolves three quarters of a turn in a clockwise
direction as it ascends nearly fifty feet from bottom to top. The surface
of the ramp is unpaved, but smooth except for the parallel tracks designed
to accommodate merchant carts. A few murder holes are hidden in the wall to
aid in repelling would-be attackers foolish to attempt an invasion.

    This great hall is where the royal officers make major decisions about
justice that govern the whole kingdom of Thorbardin. As the dwarven society
is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the
god Reorx, this hall also functions as the dwarves' most holy temple. Giant
marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. The area to
the west of here has caved in, and the dwarves haven't repaired it yet. The
hall continues north, while bronze doors guard the entrance to the east.

    An enormous anvil of red granite stands on a platform suspended over a
bottomless pit by four arching stone bridges holding it up. The runes of
divinity carved around the base of the anvil clearly indicate that it is an
altar to Reorx. The altar gleams proudly under the light of huge glittering
diamonds embedded in the domed black ceiling to resemble stars, arranged
like the constellations of Paladine and Takhisis circling each other. The
bridges lead off in each of the cardinal directions, but since the southern
part of the hall has caved in, the end of that bridge has been blocked.

[36mSouth Hall of Justice[0;37m
    This great hall is where the royal officers make major decisions about
justice that govern the whole kingdom of Thorbardin. As the dwarven society
is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the
god Reorx, this hall also functions as the dwarves' most holy temple. Giant
marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. The south
side of the hall has caved in, and the dwarves have not repaired it yet. A
door to the west must lead to some private chambers, while rubies set into 
the ground lead towards the arched bridge to the holy altar to the east.

    This great hall is where the royal officers make major decisions about
justice that govern the whole kingdom of Thorbardin. As the dwarven society
is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the

marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. The south
side of the hall has caved in, and the dwarves have not repaired it yet. A

    Paved with striated granite cobblestones, this broad tunnel is one of
the fabled Roads that makes travel through Thorbardin easy. Merchant and
farming wagons occasionally trundle on by, moving raw materials or finished
goods from one clan's city to another. The Road is wide enough for eight
wagons to pass through, continuing to the east and west from here.

    The giant black iron gate to the south is made of inch-thick bars and
appears to be nigh indestructible. Dwarven runes etched into the dolomite
plaque hanging over the gate proclaim this the entrance to Daerbardin, and
a separate sign opposite the gates indicates that this is the Fifteenth
Road. The dark cobblestones of the Road continue to the west, while to the
east, the Road ends abruptly at the entrance to massive mushroom warrens.

    The giant black iron gate to the south is made of inch-thick bars and
appears to be nigh indestructible. Dwarven runes etched into the dolomite
plaque hanging over the gate proclaim this the entrance to Daerbardin, and
a separate sign opposite the gates indicates that this is the Fifteenth
Road. The dark cobblestones of the Road continue to the west, while to the
east, the Road ends abruptly at the entrance to massive mushroom warrens.

    Three of Thorbardin's massive Roads come together to meet at this busy
intersection. The ground is paved with striated granite cobblestones which
have been arranged in angular patterns that form a fourteen-pointed star.
The sign in the center of the intersection says the Ninth Road leads off to
the west, the Fourteenth Road lies north of here, and the Fifteenth Road
extends to the east. At the southern end of the busy intersection stands a
massive marble hall guarded by a pair of gigantic bronze doors.

    Except for a few snoring gully dwarves napping the among rotting crates
on the east side of the wharf the area is deserted. A purple miasma hangs
over the mound of broken crates, but abruptly stops--almost as if a divine
power erected an invisible wall to block the stench. Contrasting the filthy
east, a broad tunnel opens to the south. A large winch system sits upon
the rocky shore, and thick cables stretch across the Urkhan Sea to guide 
mechanized ferries over the lapping water. The sign here says that ferries 
will take passengers to the Life Tree at the center of the Urkhan Sea.

    Built on the limestone island beneath the Life Tree at the center of
Thorbardin, these docks bustle with activity as dwarves from every clan
pass through on the way to the taverns, forges, and shops housed within. A
large winch system sits upon the rocky shore, and thick cables stretch off

will deposit passengers near the cities of Agharbardin and Daerbardin.

from here, widening gradually as it rises towards the shadowy ceiling far
above the Urkhan Sea. The outer surface of the stalactite is covered with
an unusual, iridescent coral which casts a warm light that illuminates the
vast cavern surrounding it. Here at its base, the magnificent stalactite
tapers until it is only as wide around as a dwarven waist where it merges
with the limestone island beneath it. A trio of vertical transport shafts
cut through the center of the Life Tree, and the screeching pulleys of the
steam-powered lifts drown out the sounds coming from the nearby docks.

made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone

the chains in the transport shafts, and almost every single one stops on
this level to drop off a few gruff dwarven commoners. The area is fairly
clean except for some small piles of refuse, as if the garbage collectors
don't come by frequently enough. All of the massive stone archways leading
away from the lift station are plain and unadorned, but the archway to the

this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must
have fallen off contraptions being transported to other parts of the huge

made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.
