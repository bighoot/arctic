here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A

partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    This slight path cuts into the dry plains of Abanasinia like a knife.
Although there are a few fresh tracks, the arid landscape keeps this trail
from becoming overgrown with vegetation. Upon a glance, you determine that
most of the tracks were made by unshod horses. From this distance you can
barely discern the outlines of the tents of Que-teh tribe to the northeast.

    This well-trod path through Que-teh Village allows easy access to the
few larger and more populated tents of the encampment. It also provides the
major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. A small tent has been
constructed close to the edge of the path, and can be entered to the east.
The path bends gently here, and its course can be followed to the north and
west.

    You are standing in the middle of a dark, cozy tent. Thick, neatly
trimmed furs of numerous beasts serve as carpeting for this quaint little
room. The lighting is provided by small, rustic lanterns hung upon each of
the tent's four main support poles. The central support pole is rather
large and carved with intricate runes from top to bottom, portraying the
hunt of some great, mystical beast. A bedroll rests on the floor of the
southeast corner of the tent, surrounded by books. Stacks of books and
tanned hides with spell components laid out on them occupy the rest of the
room.

[36mSouthern Avenue[0;37m
    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

but not as many as to the south. The road runs in the near shadows of the
Kharolis mountains which can be seen off to the west, beyond a great lake.
The mountains appear to run north for some distance before ending. The

because of their proximity to the small town. A thick forest of pine trees
lies to the west, beyond which the Crystalmir Lake can be seen. To the east

Lake, which juts into the land at the north and stretches out far to the
west. The sun glints off the water, which ripples slightly as a pleasant
wind blows across it. Nattering squirrels can be heard in the forest of
pine stretching out to the southeast, beyond which the sounds of
civilization rise from the village of Solace. As the trail follows the
curve of the lake it heads south along the shoreline, and to the east where
it rounds another bend.

[36mAlong the Shore of Crystalmir[0;37m
    Weaving its way around a corner of the lake, this small trail runs
between Crystalmir and a dense forest of pine. Squirrels chatter as they
dart from tree to tree in a frenetic chase, startling a red-headed
woodpecker into flight. The sunlight trickles through the forest of dense
evergreens, which cover the ground to the south and east. To the north and
west the sandy trail continues along the shoreline.

    You are at the corner of a large lake, which fills your vision far to

grain can be seen. The pine-covered trail follows the shoreline to the
south into thicker woods and north.

because of their proximity to the small town. A thick forest of pine trees
lies to the west, beyond which the Crystalmir Lake can be seen. To the east
this dirt trail merges with a wide road.

Kharolis mountains which can be seen off to the west, beyond a great lake.
The mountains appear to run north for some distance before ending. The

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

the Darkenwood forest and the village of Gateway. Travelling south will take
you through the plains of Abanasinia and further on to the port town of
Newport. The plains continue onward south from this point.

the air seems to be getting somewhat colder. From a nearby hill, a deer
notices you, and bolts into the woods. From here, the road continues to the

    You are standing in the middle of a dark, cozy tent. Thick, neatly
trimmed furs of numerous beasts serve as carpeting for this quaint little
room. The lighting is provided by small, rustic lanterns hung upon each of
the tent's four main support poles. The central support pole is rather
large and carved with intricate runes from top to bottom, portraying the
hunt of some great, mystical beast. A bedroll rests on the floor of the
southeast corner of the tent, surrounded by books. Stacks of books and
tanned hides with spell components laid out on them occupy the rest of the
room.

    As you step past the first few tents, Que-teh village takes form.
Numerous tents of varying sizes can be seen in all directions. While on the
surface this village appears to be somewhat permanent, closer inspection
reveals that if desired the Que-teh could easily break camp and move to a
more fertile landscape. To the north lies the exit to Que-teh village,
while to the east and west a circular path winds through the village.

been built as a rest stop to provide a safe haven for travellers. The hovel
sits off to the west of the main road here. The road itself stretches out
to the north and east. The terrain to the east becomes dry and dusty,
while you can see what appears to be a forest on the edge of the plains to
the north.
