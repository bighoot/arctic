here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge

    You step slowly through the bog placing one foot in front of the other
and testing the waters as you go. Finding it relatively firm, you proceed
only to slip on something beneath the murky water and plunge head first
into the mud. When you stand and wipe the mud from your face and can
finally see again, you find you've lost your sense of direction, and with
it any hope of finding a road leading from this place.

    Here the road leads across a large bog, crossing it at one of the more
narrow points. The bog is rather wide to the east, but not quite as wide to
the west. The road has been built up with stones, wood and dirt to maintain
a stable platform for travellers. Its not a work of art but it does the
job. Foothills are visible to the north and the vast plains of Dergoth are
spread out to the northeast. The bog can be seen in all the cardinal
directions from here, but lucky for you the raised road leads north and
south through the bog.

    You struggle more and more with every step to move through the thick

still forced every few moments to stop and rest your legs as they get tired
from marching through the mud. Taking in the area around you, you can see
nothing but the bog in all directions. The bog seems to get thicker and

    Moving quickly through the bog, your foot suddenly catches on
something beneath the water and you plunge head first into the murky water
beneath you. Attempting to pick yourself up from the mud, you find that you
cannot lift your feet. They are stuck fast in the mud and try as you might,
you cannot pull them free. You can feel your feet slowly sinking into the
mud, pulling you deeper and deeper into the water of the bog. Soon, the
water will be over your head and you will not be able to breathe. You grasp
and struggle to pull yourself free, but it only makes you sink quicker.
Finding no choice, you stop struggling and sit still, waiting to die.

    This clearing is set off from the main road. The lush undergrowth of
the forest forms a living boundary around its edges. In the center of the
clearing is a huge vallenwood. Looking up into the vallenwood, you spy what
looks like a small shop. A stairway spirals down around the trunk, reaching
the ground right before you. Northern Avenue is visible to your west. A
small sign is posted next to the stairway.

leading through some verdant rolling hills. The sky is partially cloudy,

is almost a distinguishable line where the sands from the plains meets the
grass at the edge of the hills. The sun warms the hills, but some light

The trees and foliage provide an impassable barrier to entering the forest
from here, forming a natural border with the rest of the world. To the east

of Silvanesti. The path weaves through the trees, now thicker from the
looming forests to the south. Brilliant light-rays shine down from the
dense canopy above the forest floor. Sparse foliage and a lack of downed
trees along the trail indicate this path sees some amount of traffic.
Traveling here seems peaceful and unencumbered.

    The trail continues to the east and west, along the edge of the Forest
of Silvanesti. Tall timbers line the sides of the path that creates a
quaint corridor effect. The trees seem to thin out here, giving way to a
more verdant landscape of various shrubbery. Animals trails intersect the
main path leading through the area. Mountain ranges are barely visible to
the north and to the east the terrain seems more rigid and bare. Traveling
here seems peaceful and unencumbered.

The land here suffers badly from the unrelenting winds that blow across the
desert to the west. Lizards take shelter in the shadows of the rocks where
the sand is not hot enough to roast them, but there is no shade large
enough for larger animals. Each step sinks into the searing sand, the air
thick and hazy, each breath like drowning in lava.

    The beating sun bakes the dirt road in such heat that the road has
cracked into what almost resembles cobblestones. Insects scurry across,
careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only
option is to continue either north or south.

continues straight with very little to see except for an expansive yellow
sea of sand.

and heat waves. To the west the road seeps into the endless dunes of which
this road is flanked to both the north and the south. Far to the southeast
lies the fabled city of Port Balifor.

across the parched yellow grasses of the plains towards Delphon to the

of Delphon, a large city whose towering black gates glitter in both

the great city of Delphon or beginning the trek to Port Balifor which rests
southeast of here, along the shores of the Khurman Sea. The breeze dies

     The small trail is surrounded by light forest on either side of it.
To the north, the trail leads out of the forest and towards a large,
stench-filled swamp. The trail also cuts south away from the swamp and back
into the woods of that area. Scanning the region, you are unable to see any
signs of life, besides small birds above you perched in the trees.

     Before you to the north, a vast swamp expands for some distance, and
further beyond the swamp to the north you notice a dense forest. An
abundance of swamp vegetation prevents you from going into the swamp
directly from here. A small path cuts along the edge of the swamp to the
west. The path also bends and leads south away from the swamp.

     The small, winding path along the edge of the swamp continues to the
east and west. Heavy swamp vegetation to the north blocks your way into the
swamp from here. You are unable to travel to the south either, as dense
trees and vegetation block your movement. You have no choice, at this time,
but to stay on the small dirt path.

     As you reach the western edge of the swamp, you mutter with disgust as
the stench begins to take its affect on you. Traveling through the swamp
has gotten your boots and pants filled with water. The swamp comes to an
end to the west against a dense forest that you cannot pass through. Your
only course of travel is back deeper into the swamp in the hope of finding
an exit from it.

vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    The road is cut from among the huge vallenwoods which protect and house
the inhabitants of Solace. The limbs overhead entwine with one another to
provide a canopy of green foliage which filters out the heat of the sun,
while allowing dim light to shine through. One particularly large
vallenwood stands at the edge of the road. Looking up into it, you notice a
rather large temple is nestled among the limbs. A small stairway spirals
down around the trunk and ends at the road, providing an entry to the
temple. The road itself leads east deeper into the forest and west towards

[36mA Poorly Hidden Trail[0;37m
    The trail is quite obvious here. The farther from the main route
through the plains you get, the trail is concealed less and less, travelers
being less careful with their foot steps. The trail heads off to the west
or to the south. The west appears to be more trails, but the south opens in
to a small meadow surrounded by rocks and a few bushes.

    The outside world has forgotten this secluded corner, leaving it to the
few locals and hunters that happen to stumble across it. A graceful meadow
spreads out before you and covers the land with a small amount of peace. A
barely noticable trail extends to the north, off into the plains.

    Silence has converged on this area. The wind does not whistle and no
animals stir to distrib the quiet. The world has chosen to ignore this
meadow, leaving the few outlanders that pass through to bask in its awesome
simplicity. Rocks and brush form a circle around patches of dirt and tufts
The meadow continues to the southwest. The ground here is covered with a
large red spot, resembling where an animal has fallen to hunters.

    The silence converges on the area allowing nothing but the loudest of

form a quiet haven from the rest of the world. The few animals that come
here leave barely a trace of the time they spent. A few of those animal
tracks can be seen heading to the east here, but there is nothing
apparent in that direction except a scraggly bush.

    Grass converges on the area, concealing a path underfoot to all but the

except south, where the path continues. A few red spots dot the area and a
couple of black patches have been burned into the grass. After close
inspection, large footprints can be seen in the trail, something was moving
fast through here.

and head off to the east, right into a wall of thick grass. Whatever made

not much can be seen in this direction. The western branch becomes a swampy
mess, water and long grass blades cover the area, but a definite path can
be seen this way. The eastern trail is the most hospitable, it is a well
cut and often used path that almost appears to be a road.

    The entire village forms a circle around this point; all movement
within the village can be monitored from here. A large fire jumps and flails
in the wind.  Rising some fifteen feet in the air, it dominates the area and
provides light and heat for the entire village. Huts can be seen in all
directions, a small path between the huts lies just north. A few of the huts
have entrance-ways that are plainly visible from this location.

    A large circle allows access to all points of the village, but the
arrangement of the huts also keep outsiders from entering at multiple
points. The set up allows the villagers a minor amount of protection from a
large force. From the looks of things, the protection did not help much in
the latest assualt. A few huts have been burned completely to the ground.
Most of the other buildings have holes in the walls or some scorch marks on
the outside.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the

    The narrow bough comes to an end here. The new school of magic lies to
the west, while strange chanting can be heard from the north. A hut built
from sewn patches of animal skins stretched across the vallenwood branches
lie to the east. A small grove can be seen at the base of the tree, as a
small branch slopes gently down from here providing passage. Finally, the
bough moves back toward the trunk to the south.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    The road is cut from among the huge vallenwoods which protect and house
the inhabitants of Solace. The limbs overhead entwine with one another to
provide a canopy of green foliage which filters out the heat of the sun,
while allowing dim light to shine through. One particularly large
vallenwood stands at the edge of the road. Looking up into it, you notice a
rather large temple is nestled among the limbs. A small stairway spirals
down around the trunk and ends at the road, providing an entry to the
temple. The road itself leads east deeper into the forest and west towards
Solace Square.

    The high grasses of the plains bend ever-so-slightly as a zephyr races
across the land. The chirping of insects and the rustling of grass by small
animals, remind you that you are not alone. Looking west you see a range of
mountains in the distance. Looking east you see another range of mountains
in the distance. To the north, you can see three columns of black smoke
grasping the sky like the claw of a dragon.

[36mTracks Underfoot[0;37m
    A few tracks and a couple bent blades of grass betray the presense of a
path underfoot. The entire area is completely covered with long, dull green
blades of grass, each identical to the next. The grass makes every
direction appear the same. Finding your way through the plains would be
difficult if not impossible, except for the trail that has been left here
for anyone to follow.

    The grass becomes sparse in sections, giving a clearer picture of the
ground. The ground has quite a few prints on it, both animal and human. The
trail must be used as a hunting route for a local tribe of nomads or a
large party of hunters from Solace must have just come through here. The
trail heads north and east from here.

    The trail is quite obvious here. The farther from the main route
through the plains you get, the trail is concealed less and less, travelers
being less careful with their foot steps. The trail heads off to the west
or to the south. The west appears to be more trails, but the south opens in
to a small meadow surrounded by rocks and a few bushes.

    The outside world has forgotten this secluded corner, leaving it to the

spreads out before you and covers the land with a small amount of peace. A

    Silence has converged on this area. The wind does not whistle and no
animals stir to distrib the quiet. The world has chosen to ignore this
meadow, leaving the few outlanders that pass through to bask in its awesome
simplicity. Rocks and brush form a circle around patches of dirt and tufts
The meadow continues to the southwest. The ground here is covered with a

    The silence converges on the area allowing nothing but the loudest of

form a quiet haven from the rest of the world. The few animals that come
here leave barely a trace of the time they spent. A few of those animal
tracks can be seen heading to the east here, but there is nothing
apparent in that direction except a scraggly bush.

couple of black patches have been burned into the grass. After close
inspection, large footprints can be seen in the trail, something was moving

    A path splits off in three directions here, offering a wide variety of
terrains. The northern path leads into a thick field of grass and rocks;
not much can be seen in this direction. The western branch becomes a swampy
mess, water and long grass blades cover the area, but a definite path can
be seen this way. The eastern trail is the most hospitable, it is a well
cut and often used path that almost appears to be a road.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

the force of a flash flood raging through here. The dwarves of Thorbardin

    A moist draft of air hangs in the air, making the dust less bothersome
and air more breathable. Stacks of unused timber and piles of broken rock lay
scattered about. A thin layer of dust covers everything that would suggest
the dwarves have discovered something very bad and have dropped everything to
hastily retreat to the other regions of the mine.

    The walls are typical of dwarven mining operations, picks have scoured
the walls and dwarven brass lanterns hang from the ceiling, having burnt out
long ago. The air is damp and heavy here, moisture condenses on the walls and
beads of water trickle down them. Water pools in small pockets and some
slowly dribbles down the slope to the east. Small pockets of copper ore have
oxidized here, giving the walls a stained blue azurite and green malachite
mosaic. The tunnel leads east and west here.

around a corner to the south. You are at the end of this tunnel. A dark void
of space extends out before you. The air is heavy and damp. A small trickle
of water that flows down the tunnel splashes over the side and you can hear
it land in a body of water. The high moisture in the air creates a fog that
prevents any penetration of your light sources. You can retreat to the tunnel
or step blindly off the cliff, into the unknown...

    Upon this small rock plateau, a small village has been constructed.
There is not much visible from here, due to the everpresent moist fog that
envelops everything. You can make out several humanoid figures milling
about nearby and several nets and racks of drying fish have been built near
the edge of the plateau. You can vaguely remember stories about an
amphibious race living under Thorbardin. A path leads north into what seems
to be the heart of the village. The path also meanders along the edge of
the plateau, to the south. The lake is below you, at the bottom of a steep
bank.

    The stone path leads away from the village. The path is lined on either
side by large stones, which are there to mark the walkway. The path
meanders along the edge of the plateau. The fog is light here, allowing you
to see parts of a dark cold lake that sits like a mirror below you. A high
cliff is to your east and the stone boundaries of the road prevent you from
wandering over the edge in the fog. The path rises slightly to the south,
where a stone slab sits atop a hill.

up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds

The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to

    A narrow road here runs east through some plains toward the Eastwall
mountains while to the west the road continues through the plains. The
plains spread out to the west for a short distance before ending at an arm
of the Kharolis mountains. The Kharolis mountains lie off to the west and
run north-south in this area of Abanasinia. The foothills of the Eastwall
mountains can be seen off to the east and the mountain range appears to run
northeasterly from this spot.

    This highway across the plains of Solamnia widens to the south as it
enters the settlement of Harrying, and splits off towards the west a short
distance to the north. Merchants loaded down with goods they purchased in
Port o'Call slowly make their way northwest towards Caergoth and Palanthas
where they can sell these items for a sizable profit.

    Once inside the masterfully crafted gates, the astonishing beauty of
the city unfolds before your eyes. At the corners, four great spires tower
above, a reminder that eyes are always on the activities both below in the
city and afar. Pure white stones tile the streets beneath your feet, and an
elaborately decorated archway opens up into the heart of the city to the
south.

    Leatherworkers and armourers work side by side, frantically patching
chainmail that is horrifyingly and obviously second-hand. How they acquire
their raw materials is hardly a mystery as you note bloodstains and bits of
flesh being scrubbed by small children behind the stalls. Patched armor is
better than running off to battle in nothing better than smallclothes,
however, and conscripts vye for even the poorest specimen the "craftsmen"
have to offer.

elaborately decorated archway opens up into the heart of the city to the

windows at the horizon. Listening intently, you can hear the city bustling
with activity, as weary travellers make this a frequent stop. A small path

     Branching off from the main road that runs through southern Solamnia,
this small trail slowly ascends upwards as its plunges into the snowy and
rugged Garnet Mountains.  The mountains are said to be the home of the
dwarven nation of Garnet, enemies of the highlord and Lemish.  The
vegetation thins out as you travel away from the plains and into the
mountains.  Occasionally, you spot a few mountain animals here and there.
You hope that these shy creatures are the only ones inhabiting the
snow-topped peaks.

     The small tunnel that opened from above decends rather steeply into
the Garnet Mountains.  Though hard to tell, the tunnel seems to curve
slightly southward. There is nothing but darkness here and it is hard to
travel without bumping your head on the short (even for Gnomes and Dwarves)
ceiling.

    The tunnel from the overground finally ends its descent and flattens
out. The tunnel gently rolls to the south, where it melds into the dwarven
city of Garnet. Garnet is small city, famous for its mining operations.
Unlike most dwarves, Garnet is eager to help aid the humans to the north
rid the land of the foul dragonarmies.

Every so often, then tunnel turns into a small hall, carved with fine

    Due to the impending invasion by Lemish, the dwarves of Garnet have
cautiously barracaded their mines. Huge blocks of granite have been piled
all over the entrance, so that no enemy parties can use the extensive
tunnel system to attack the city. To the north a small platform is set over
a ledge that overlooks nothing in particular. No enemies will be
approaching from that angle, that's for sure.

a peaceful nation, it has mobilized for war against the kingdom of Lemish
and the dragon armies. The smith here must work endlessly to put out the
weapons and armor needed to mount such an offensive.  There is no exit,
save for the one you came in.  You are very hot and want to leave.

     A large, underground road slices through the Garnet Mountains here.
The road is more of a large tunnel, carved by the efforts of several
thousand dwarves over a relatively short period of time.  Caked in the
walls of the tunnel are several large stones, all glowing and radiating a
comfy worth. Every so often, then tunnel turns into a small hall, carved
with fine precision and intended to make the road more comfortable to
travel.  The halls and tunnel are relatively short and  you are forced to
duck in some areas.

it is obvious that the dwarves quickly carved the prison as the prepared

iron door, bolted and locked several times over, that leads to the large

[36mGlitter Road[0;37m
     A large, underground road slices through the Garnet Mountains here.
The road is more of a large tunnel, carved by the efforts of several
thousand dwarves over a relatively short period of time.  Caked in the
walls of the tunnel are several large stones, all glowing and radiating a
comfy worth. Every so often, then tunnel turns into a small hall, carved
with fine precision and intended to make the road more comfortable to
travel.  The halls and tunnel are relatively short and  you are forced to
duck in some areas.

     The tunnel opens up into a large rock garden.  The garden is huge and
hypnotic to look at.  Stones of every size and color are lined up in small
rows in between cobblestone paths.  The gardens make a large square, with
all paths eventually reaching the center of the square.  In the center,
there is a large plant, its flowers wide open.  It does appear that
a small stream of sunlight could come in from a hole in the ceiling.
The garden is quite peaceful.

giving indication that it was only recently made.  In several places, you
are forced to crawl in order to protect your head from the looming and

Every so often, then tunnel turns into a small hall, carved with fine

hard.  The tunnel can be considered more of a hall; its tall, square shape
is a welcome sight to you.  Several torches are embedded along the wall,
radiating a large quantity of light.  Every once in a while a statue has
been carved into the walls of the hall.  The statues are quite detailed.

radiating a large quantity of light.  Every once-in-a-while a statue has

[36mPalace Entrance to the Mines[0;37m
     At one time, this small tunnel connected to the large network of
tunnels that made up the legendary mines of Garnet.  The King, on his
weekly visits to inspect iron ore and gold production, would decend down a
large stone staircase here.  Unfortunately, the costly war with Lemish and
the fear of invasion somehow from below has forced the dwarves to close
down the entrance. Several boulders and other objects block passage down,
into the mines.

northern and southern walls are huge statues carved from what appears to be
gold. In between the statues are several elven paintings, most of them
depicting great dwarven heroes and lore.  At the far end of the hall,
against the western wall, sits a huge throne.  The throne, made from solid
gold and decorated with hundreds of small jewels, must be worth a fortune
above the ground. A large, purple carpet leads up to the throne.

up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and

partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

The vast plains of Dergoth extend to the northeast, beyond the Breaks
Foothills, and a very large bog has formed to the southeast.

    The passage is barely passable, but it can be done. To the west, giant
boulder glowers at the road. To the north, the passage continues, while
some ruined gates lie southward. Two passes are cut into the middle of the
passage towards the east and west. The remnants of an abandoned stable sit
to the west, while it's unclear what lies beyond the pass to the east.

[36mBefore Some Ruined Brass Gates[0;37m
    Before you stand two huge brass gates which once guarded the entrance
to Thorbardin. However, a terrible earthquake has caused the passageway
beyond the gates to collapse, sealing off the entrance forever. The giant
gates have fallen off their hinges and lean forlornly against the piles of
rubble. Although the passage into the kingdom is destroyed, the indomitable
mountain known as Cloudseeker still stands, reaching towards the sky. To
the north and south, narrow paths lead around the cliffs surrounding the
mountain, and a sloping path to the east leads back down the mountain.

[36mA Tight Passage[0;37m
    The passage way between the mountain walls and the piles of boulders
is just wide enough for a fair-size adventuring party to pass through. The
boulders look unsteady and you would hate to have to climb up on them, but
thankfully don't look like there will be an avalanche. To the north, the
path opens up and you can see a set of ruined gates, while to the south,
the tight passageway continues through the barren mountain range.

    There is a fair-size clearing here, but as you look north and west, you
see the passageways are much tighter. To the north, there is a passage
between the walls of the mountain and a bunch of boulders and rubble piled
high. Westward, a small path winds its way into the depths of the Kharolis
Mountains, passing between a mountainside and jagged cliffs. To the south,
a steep, but usable path leads down to the road near Tarsis.

    The giant rock looming over the path is as tall as a vallenwood, and it
must be the biggest boulder on the entire continent. Although its surface
has been methodically eroded by weather, mere nature has done nothing to
diminish its massive size. A narrow path leads off to the east, while the
foot of an impossibly tall mountain lies a few steps to the north.

almost as if the rock was hewn flat to ease the passage of trade carts. Of
course, there are no cart marks and few bootprints, so perhaps it's just
nature playing tricks on the mind. The unusually flat ground continues and
expands to the west, while a narrow gap between the giant boulders off to
the south allows relatively easy movement in that direction.

    A row of heavy fortifications are arranged facing the southern wall,
designed to protect dwarven warriors in case invaders are somehow able to
break through the giant stone plug known as Southgate. Any invading forces
resilient enough to make it past the first line of defenses will be forced
to suddenly turn right, which makes fighting very awkward for right-handed
fighters, to ascend the huge spiral ramp that leads into Thorbardin.

    A row of heavy fortifications are arranged facing the southern wall,
designed to protect dwarven warriors in case invaders are somehow able to
break through the giant stone plug known as Southgate. Any invading forces
resilient enough to make it past the first line of defenses will be forced
to suddenly turn right, which makes fighting very awkward for right-handed
fighters, to ascend the huge spiral ramp that leads into Thorbardin.

    This small side street is simple and unassuming. The street is unpaved,
and it is flanked by simple houses with plain wooden doors. Occasionally, a
child darts by, running off to play, but otherwise the side street is very
quiet. The street spills out onto the Sixteenth Road to the west.

    Depending on which direction you're traveling, this is either the end
or the beginning of the Sixteenth Road. The Road is paved with cobbelstones
of pink granite that merge seamlessly into a giant, arching stone bridge
that spans the yawning chasm to the north. The south end of the road slopes
down and turns abruptly to wind down a huge spiral ramp. There is also a
small side street to the east which leads to a residential area.

[36mSouth Hall of Justice[0;37m
    This great hall is where the royal officers make major decisions about
justice that govern the whole kingdom of Thorbardin. As the dwarven society
is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the
god Reorx, this hall also functions as the dwarves' most holy temple. Giant
marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. The massive
hall continues south and west and the sign hanging on the locked gate to
the giant lift in the eastern wall says it is for official use only.

    An enormous anvil of red granite stands on a platform suspended over a
bottomless pit by four arching stone bridges holding it up. The runes of
divinity carved around the base of the anvil clearly indicate that it is an
altar to Reorx. The altar gleams proudly under the light of huge glittering
diamonds embedded in the domed black ceiling to resemble stars, arranged
like the constellations of Paladine and Takhisis circling each other. The
bridges lead off in each of the cardinal directions, but since the southern
part of the hall has caved in, the end of that bridge has been blocked.

[36mThe Base of the Life Tree[0;37m
    The gigantic stalactite known as the Life Tree of the Hylar soars up
from here, widening gradually as it rises towards the shadowy ceiling far
above the Urkhan Sea. The outer surface of the stalactite is covered with
an unusual, iridescent coral which casts a warm light that illuminates the
vast cavern surrounding it. Here at its base, the magnificent stalactite
tapers until it is only as wide around as a dwarven waist where it merges
with the limestone island beneath it. A trio of vertical transport shafts
cut through the center of the Life Tree, and the screeching pulleys of the
steam-powered lifts drown out the sounds coming from the nearby docks.

the big chains in the transport shafts, but almost none of them bother to
stop on this level. The high ceiling and the archways leading away from
the station are unusually tall for dwarven architecture, as if this area
is designed to accommodate the needs of bigger races. Sturdy wooden boards
block movement through the archways in all directions except north.

[36mA Cluttered Square[0;37m
    This large square has been carefully carved out of the limestone, and
it was once a beautiful testament to dwarven stonework. Now, however, the
scratched stone floor is littered with loose gears, broken tools, random
screws and half-finished contraptions. The famed Hylar engineers must work
in the nearby buildings, perfecting the technology that the dwarves use to
defend their mountain home and keep their mighty kingdom running.

[36mLevel 10 Lift Station[0;37m
    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a dwarf steps off on
this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must
have fallen off contraptions being transported to other parts of the huge
mountain kingdom. Unlike gnomish parts, these spare parts are as finely
made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

this level to drop off a few gruff dwarven commoners. The area is fairly
clean except for some small piles of refuse, as if the garbage collectors
don't come by frequently enough. All of the massive stone archways leading

south appears to have been recently and permanently boarded up.

[36mThe Blue Salamander Tavern[0;37m
    While one might think the taverns of dwarves to be fine establishments
given the race's reputation for drinking and the infamy of their signature
beverage, most of them are actually pretty simple watering holes like this
one. Since this tavern isn't frequented very much anymore, it's started to
get dingy, but is otherwise a serviceable place to get a stiff drink.

    While this enormous grand hall is only slightly less gilded than the

palaces elsewhere in the world. The owner's taste for platinum and gold is
again on display, this time tempered with mahogany accents that make the
room less blinding to stand in. Besides the antechamber to the west, the
only other exit is a small platinum door on the north side of the hall. It
seems like the owner of this home ran out of money, since there aren't any
doors in the doorways in the gilded walls to the east and south.

    While this enormous grand hall is only slightly less gilded than the
antechamber before it, it is still more opulently decorated than most royal
palaces elsewhere in the world. The owner's taste for platinum and gold is
again on display, this time tempered with mahogany accents that make the
room less blinding to stand in. Besides the antechamber to the west, the
only other exit is a small platinum door on the north side of the hall. It

again on display, this time tempered with mahogany accents that make the
room less blinding to stand in. Besides the antechamber to the west, the
only other exit is a small platinum door on the north side of the hall. It
seems like the owner of this home ran out of money, since there aren't any
doors in the doorways in the gilded walls to the east and south.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and the dwarves who disembark on this
level include representatives from many different clans. The station walls
are adorned with majestic sculptures that tell the stories how all of the
dwarven clans came together to found the mighty nation of Thorbardin. Each
of the four archways is carved in the style and stone of a different clan,
named by the plaques above them: Theiwar, Daewar, Daergar and Klar.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and the dwarves who disembark on this
level include representatives from many different clans. The station walls
are adorned with majestic sculptures that tell the stories how all of the
dwarven clans came together to found the mighty nation of Thorbardin. Each
of the four archways is carved in the style and stone of a different clan,
named by the plaques above them: Theiwar, Daewar, Daergar and Klar.

[36mAt the Foot of a Mountain[0;37m
    The ground here at the foot of the huge mountain is unnaturally smooth,
almost as if the granite was hewn flat to create a plaza where trade carts
could gather at the foot of the biggest mountain in the region. Of course,
there are no cart marks and few bootprints, even if the smooth area seems
unnaturally wide and the cliff formed by the mountain meeting the ground is
perfectly vertical. The unusually flat ground narrows a bit as it continues
to the east and west from here, flanked by an impervious wall of boulders.

    The ground here at the foot of the mountain is unnaturally smooth,
almost as if the rock was hewn flat to ease the passage of trade carts. Of
course, there are no cart marks and few bootprints, so perhaps it's just
nature playing tricks on the mind. The unusually flat ground continues and
expands to the west, while a narrow gap between the giant boulders off to
the south allows relatively easy movement in that direction.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.
