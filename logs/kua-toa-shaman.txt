THE CHANNEL SKILL
Format: CHANNEL <spirit> <character in room>

Shamans may use this skill to draw energy from spirits and manipulate it in
either of two ways: gently shape it and channel it to a group member, healing
them, refreshing them and helping them remember a few spells, or hurl it
forcefully at their foes, damaging them badly. Drawing energy from spirits in
this way will deplete their life force, banishing them from the world.

Details:
- Utility skill which banishes a spirit, giving its life force to a target.
- A friendly target will receive healing, moves, and spell memorization.
- An enemy target will receive damage of type NEGATIVE_ENERGY and
  may be forced to the ground, unable to take action for a time.
