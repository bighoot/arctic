[36mThe Pig and Whistle[0;37m
    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

[36mThe Tavern Square[0;37m
    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

[36mDeath Row[0;37m
    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

[36mStairwell to the Dungeons[0;37m
    Your footfalls echo off the bare walls of the stairwell. The stone feels
cold and damp to the touch only warming where flickering torches hang from
iron sconces set in the walls. The steps lead you down to the dungeons
where Balifor's criminals are locked away ... hopefully.

    The stone steps end near the bottom of a sturdy ironwood door to the

    Flames flicker from torches set in the opposite walls casting eerie
shadows along the length of the corridor. They give little warmth and
barely any light for you to see your way. The air is cold and stale down
here, the mood oppressive as barred dungeon cells stretch down the hall.
The groans and mutterings of prisoners fill your ears. To the east and west
lie two doors.

[36mA Musty Cell[0;37m
    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Open doorways lead north and south from here, and a dark wood paneled
hallway runs straight to the east. Taking up a majority of the western wall
is a gate of light brown stone, set into a smooth archway that stands as
tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though

    Metal tables occupy the room, facing no direction in particular. Wooden
stools stand underneath some of them for soldiers to sit as they eat, others
roll around freely on the floor overturned. The mess hall opens wide to the
west and south, easily able to house a few hundred hungry trainees. A short
way to the south a cooking station boils with aromatic smoke, filling the
entire hall with the smell of hearty meats.

    Metal tables occupy the room, facing no direction in particular. Wooden
stools stand underneath some of them for soldiers to sit as they eat, others
roll around freely on the floor overturned. The mess hall opens wide to the
west and south, easily able to house a few hundred hungry trainees. A short
way to the south a cooking station boils with aromatic smoke, filling the
entire hall with the smell of hearty meats.

    The air here is thick with the smell of meaty stew, and deathly hot from
the wide oven in the southern wall. A line of bowls rests on a wooden counter
that corners off the oven, waiting to be picked up by lunching soldiers.
Metal tables form a jagged maze of walkways through the mess hall, which
opens up wide to the north and west from here. Most of the tables are topped
off with empty bowls and leftovers, and the floor is covered with food and
dirt.

    Standing before double doors carved with the two common visages of
Takhisis, you are immediately struck by a powerful evil aura. Stone walls
meet up with a curved ceiling, and lead westward through a twisting
passage, while to the east the foreboding doors of a temple to the dark
goddess lie before you. Clearly the coward's way is to flee west away from
the danger within, though those who wish to follow in the footsteps of
heroes would surely brave on to the dangers of the temple.

in a solid wall to the south. From here you can access the floor above
this, what would be ground level in this subterranean building, by a flight
of stairs against the southern wall. Though you can't see into it very well
from here, you can feel the breeze of freshly circulated air from the room
above, a welcome change from the stagnant and stale air of these
underground halls. To the north the hallway you are in, meets up with
another hallway running east-west.

    Dark wooden panels make up the walls of the two hallways that converge
here, and dirt trails the floor following them both. Down the western
hallway you can hardly miss a large gate that stands directly at the end of
it, while the southern hallway stops at a flight of stairs that lead up to
a higher floor. The only thing of interest here appears to be a wooden door
leading east.

    Open doorways lead north and south from here, and a dark wood paneled
hallway runs straight to the east. Taking up a majority of the western wall
is a gate of light brown stone, set into a smooth archway that stands as
tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though
the safest path is anyone's guess.

luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty

strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and

    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the

up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    The room is neat and orderly, more spacious than the other rooms on
this floor. A square green rug covers a large area in the center of the
office. Atop the rug sits an ornate cedar desk neatly stacked with official
looking papers. Behind that is a cushy chair and smaller wooden chairs
arranged in front. Off to the west lies a small cot that doesn't appear to
have been slept in much.

onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Dock road is muddy here, probably from all the dirt tracked in by the
pack animals and carts brought in from the surrounding countryside.
Movement onto the docks themselves is blocked here by countless crates and
barrels that are being stored here until the arrival of the ship on which
they will be transported. To the east, numerous storefronts line the
boundaries of the docks.

    A stench has come to rest in this small path, a stench that is
uncommonly rank. The smell of fish permeates the air and dominates all
thoughts. The cobblestones underfoot are part of a small alley between a
building to the north and the town wall to the south, but they seem to
serve a much more malevolent purpose. This alley has become a storage
center for the refuse of both the dockyards to the west and the fish market
to the east. Piles of disregarded fish pieces litter the area, other
unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting
development this alley has become over the years.

    The further away from the docks and fish stands, the less likely the
smell is to invade the area. This stand has almost avoided the fishy smell
altogether, there is even a hint of apple in the air. The fruits are
displayed on a wooden cart and lined up in rows. The stand is in shambles,
but the fruit appears to be in peak form, ripe and free from bruises.

    The sounds and smells of a market surround the area. Quite a few shops
and stands can be seen, all with wonderous objects to sell. The market
isn't too large, but it does extend to the east for a little ways. A small
alley to the west seems to head away from the shops and toward the docks. A
small shop is to the north with a large wooden sign hanging just above the
entryway. A stand full of fresh fish can be seen to the south.

    A stench has come to rest in this small path, a stench that is
uncommonly rank. The smell of fish permeates the air and dominates all
thoughts. The cobblestones underfoot are part of a small alley between a
building to the north and the town wall to the south, but they seem to
serve a much more malevolent purpose. This alley has become a storage
center for the refuse of both the dockyards to the west and the fish market
to the east. Piles of disregarded fish pieces litter the area, other
unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting
development this alley has become over the years.

[36mA Dark Alley[0;37m
    The alley runs parallel with traders street, and is really nothing more
than a gutter between the tall buildings of Cannery Row and High Street.
The narrow, unlit alley is obviously used as a shortcut between the two.
You feel unusually nervous as you walk here, and small movements in the
shadows catch your eye. As you move along, you realize that your ears are
ringing because you are listening so hard.

[36mThe Tavern Square[0;37m
    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.
[33m[1mA small sundial is here, casting shadows when light is upon it.
A vial of clear liquid was left here.
An elm arrow fletched with phoenix feathers lies here. [2]
A small leather purse lies on the floor.
[0;37m[31m[1mA muscular watchman quietly patrols the streets of Port Balifor.
<BROG> Mae the Female Gnome is standing here.
A drunken sailor steadies himself as he tries to stagger back to his boat.
A merchant has erected a portable counter in the middle of the street here.

[36mThe Pig and Whistle[0;37m
    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

[36mThe Pig and Whistle[0;37m
    A small brass bell sits on a rosewood table along with a guest book.
There is no need to ring for attention, however; you are getting plenty of
that already. A brass sign assures you of the quarters' legendary comfort.
[33m[1mA pile of worn maps sits in the corner, free to adventurers.
A key shaped like a stretched out dragon has been left here.
