east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is

here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    This clearing is set off from the main road. The lush undergrowth of
the forest forms a living boundary around its edges. In the center of the
clearing is a huge vallenwood. Looking up into the vallenwood, you spy what
looks like a small shop. A stairway spirals down around the trunk, reaching
the ground right before you. Northern Avenue is visible to your west. A
small sign is posted next to the stairway.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot

north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    The gates of this village are constructed of mighty vallenwoods imported
from the northern forests. A pair of lanterns hang from each side and are
continually maintained by the local guards for continuous light. The danger
of attack from the dragon armies is always a threat in these parts. A sea
breeze blows softly from the east and the smells and sounds of Newport
invite you in.

    The pristine cobblestones of Kharas Avenue that were the trademark of
Lytburg are mirrored here, yet so worn and aged it's hard to believe they
are actually part of the same town. The grit of battle and preparation have
stinted the beauty of the side streets and back alleys that have been
neglected by haste and negligence. Away from the bustling marketplace, this
is the first indication that all is not well in the town of Lytburg.

road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

thick stone walls. The ceiling above you is curved and supported by several

they lead out into openness. The road's pavement is made of smooth, gray
cobblestones about the size of your fist. Torches mounted on iron brackets
provide almost all of the light for the tunnel. The air seems relatively
stagnant throughout the tunnel, and mixes only with the fresh outside air
at the ends. The cobblestone road heads north into the town of Vingaard,
and south into the surrounding lands of grain.

    The continental weather system that prevails in the Vingaard area
provides a consistent northwestern wind. Because of this, the city's
blacksmith has been built in the southeastern corner of the city, where the
wind blows the soot harmlessly away from the citizens. However, the close
proximity of the smith, just to the northwest, results in a fine haze of
particles in the air, and a dusting of it on the ground. The perimeter
streets stretch both north and west from here, along the walls.

    A very faint but sweet smell hangs in the air here. Best identified as
the scent of pastries, you realize that the scent originates from the
bakery just a bit west of here, the smell being carried over by the wind.
The scent adds nicely to the neighborhood, which is fairly plain and simple
but still comfortable. A bit of noise does come in from the north when
Eastern Avenue crosses, as the wares transported to and from the docks pass
by there in wagons.

    The cobblestone lanes of Eastern Perimeter Road and Eastern Avenue
intersect in this residential area of Vingaard. The city walls rise about
twenty feet into the air, towering over your head as they stretch the
length of Eastern Perimeter to the north and south. Few things but houses
are visible as you look up and down Eastern Perimeter. The houses do not
appear to be as expensive as some others in Vingaard, but still look like
very comfortable places to live. Eastern Avenue extends west to the center
of Vingaard, while Eastern Perimeter Road heads north and south.

    Eastern perimeter road runs through what seems to be a middle-class
neighborhood. The houses are made of wood and seem fairly similar in
design. Perhaps they were constructed in a hurry to provide more housing,
but they appear to be well-built and maintained. The great city walls rise
into the sky and run along the road on the eastern side, and a large gate
is visible to the south where Eastern Avenue intersects. A breeze blows in
from the northwest.

    This stretch of Eastern Perimeter is lined with little but houses. Very
few of the houses are two stories tall as most or merely single story
bungalos. For the most part, however, the houses look nice and appear
comfortable to live in. The block seems well maintained, clean, and
generally pretty safe. The cobbles that make up the street are a bit worn
but not terribly, indicating that this is one of Vingaard's less-traveled
roads. A fresh breeze blows, and a deep breath seems quite refreshing.

of this intersection, apparently the granary. Looking down Eastern
Perimeter to the south, houses of various types, mostly middle-class, are
visible. Eastern Perimeter extends a short distance to the north, where it

the city wall, a massive structure designed to keep those unwanted securely
outside. It doesn't seem as though many people enter this corner of the

together along the west side of the street.

cobblestones about the size of your fist, all of which fit together

large one to the north. The stone structure to the north is several stories
tall, and appears to be Vingaard's immense granary. A much smaller, white
stone building lies to the south. The western edge of the building is
covered with small climbing vines, but quickly thin out towards the center.

    This road runs east-west through a very clean and beautiful section of
Vingaard. Ground litter that may be expected in larger towns is not present
here. To the north stands an immense structure, spanning the entire length
of this block of Baxtrey. It appears to be Vingaard's famed library. Large
stone columns surround the building, holding up the roof. To the south lies
a much smaller building. A sign hangs above its door, bearing a gleaming
sword. The granary is visible a distance to the east.

    A large staircase lies behind a large, wrought iron gate directly to
the north. The smooth marble steps ascend to the entrance of Vingaard's
library. The library itself is constructed of pale gray stones, extends the
length of this block and rises several stories high. To the south stands a
large garden and house behind a large, locked gate. The house, like many
structures in the area, is made of stone. Trees of varying types grow in
its yard, and rustle gently as the wind passes through their leaves.

[36mThe Lobby of the Great Library[0;37m
    You stand in the lobby of Vingaard's library. Rivaled only by the great
library of Palanthas, this immense building holds volumes of ancient texts.
Soft, worn carpeting covers the floor's stone. A large desk stands facing
the front doors, apparently the source of information regarding the
whereabouts of a particular book. Looking east and west, large hallways
branch to smaller ones that pass between the bookcases. The smell of old
and decaying parchment is heavy in the air.

throughout the hallway. The smell of the ancient parchment permeates

    You stand in a narrow hallway, between the many tall bookcases. The
bookcases hold a vast wealth of knowledge, in both bound books of parchment
and scrolls. A few tablets have also been filed into the library. The smell
exuded by the decaying parchment hangs heavy in the air. The floor, unlike
the library's main hallways, is not covered with carpeting. The gray stones
beneath your feet have been worn smooth from many, many years of use.

    You stand in the lobby of Vingaard's library. Rivaled only by the great
library of Palanthas, this immense building holds volumes of ancient texts.
Soft, worn carpeting covers the floor's stone. A large desk stands facing
the front doors, apparently the source of information regarding the
whereabouts of a particular book. Looking east and west, large hallways
branch to smaller ones that pass between the bookcases. The smell of old
and decaying parchment is heavy in the air.

    You stand in a narrow hallway, between the many tall bookcases. The
bookcases hold a vast wealth of knowledge, in both bound books of parchment
and scrolls. A few tablets have also been filed into the library. The smell
exuded by the decaying parchment hangs heavy in the air. The floor, unlike
the library's main hallways, is not covered with carpeting. The gray stones
beneath your feet have been worn smooth from many, many years of use.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

walk across side by side. You notice a small temple to the east with scores
of people moving in and out, heads bowed. to the west, devout knights seek
solace and divine intervention in a shrine built into a branch. To the
south the bough climbs upward at forty-five degrees, but footholds and
handholds allow for easy progress upwards.

    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a neighboring
vallenwood tree.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

crossroad is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and merchants
alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on
the Blood Sea northeast of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder
that bandits frequent these roads.

of which the road is made is cracked and dry with lack of moisture, and
very few plants other than the occasional cactus dare grow in such a trying

The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to

    The pristine cobblestones of Kharas Avenue that were the trademark of
Lytburg are mirrored here, yet so worn and aged it's hard to believe they
are actually part of the same town. The grit of battle and preparation have
stinted the beauty of the side streets and back alleys that have been
neglected by haste and negligence. Away from the bustling marketplace, this
is the first indication that all is not well in the town of Lytburg.

working a double shift anything with a bed can look comforting.

    The hall comes to an abrupt end, splitting off in two separate

food. From the west there is only silence, but an overwhelming delicious
smell of something cooking drifts in. To the north the corridor extends to
the grand hall.

    Benches have been set up haphazardly, undoubtedly to compensate for the
increased number of knights that have arrived in Lytburg. Tables, filled
with empty plates and half-eaten food split the benches and stretch the
length of the room. For off-duty knights who aren't sleeping, this is the
place they are most likely to be found.

[36mThe Mess Hall[0;37m
    Benches have been set up haphazardly, undoubtedly to compensate for the
increased number of knights that have arrived in Lytburg. Tables, filled
with empty plates and half-eaten food split the benches and stretch the
length of the room. For off-duty knights who aren't sleeping, this is the
place they are most likely to be found.

    The hall comes to an abrupt end, splitting off in two separate

food. From the west there is only silence, but an overwhelming delicious
smell of something cooking drifts in. To the north the corridor extends to
the grand hall.

    This dreary corridor lacks any sort of ornamentation whatsoever. Two
small torches, on either wall, provide the minor light given to this
hallway, accentuating the shadows of those in the room. The floor is bare
stone here, giving the castle a more economical and less regal air. The
hall continues to the north and south, leading to the main hallway and mess
hall respectively.

    The main hall branches, quickly breaking off into another, smaller
hallway. The elaborate carpeting ends here, yielding to a more efficient
stone floor. The decorations are missing as well, and when coupled with a
more dimly area, this section of the castle, though efficient, seems more
like a dungeon.

traffic experienced lately. Commoners and knights alike hurry past, tending
to their own duties with little regard to you. South leads you deeper into

    A silver embossed stairway lies against the south wall, leading up and

nation: tarnished, yet in select places, gleaming with defiance. Voices
gruff and low can be heard above, while a detatched sense of despair floats
in from below.

    A silver embossed stairway lies against the south wall, leading up and
down. Its plain appearance and lack of care mimic the state of this
nation: tarnished, yet in select places, gleaming with defiance. Voices
gruff and low can be heard above, while a detatched sense of despair floats
in from below.

    Normally where visitors are received, the hall would be packed, however
with enemies at the gates and an army which is barely kept on its feet, the
majority of social gatherings have been postponed indefinitely. Sconces
line the walls, providing more than adequate light with which to admire
suits of armor and weapons which are mounted against the walls. A long,
green and gold carpet runs along the center of the room leading north and
south, normally vibrant but now threadbare due to hasty passage.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    This narrow, dirt road winds its way through the great forest, curving
around large trees and rocks. You can hear the chattering of hundreds of
animals all around you, and a few of the trees seem to have large claw
marks. To the south, lies the northern gate of Solace, and to the north,
the road continues. Large bushes block your view to the east and west.
