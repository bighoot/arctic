We reserve the right to delete or force a player to change his name if we feel
that it is inappropriate. Character names should be chosen in light of the world
in which Dragonlance stories take place. Compound nouns (such as Darkshadow or
Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as Superman or Judgedredd), and
silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)are inappropriate. Characters with
such names will very likely be deleted. In the event you are asked to change
names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite and
courteous: Staff members are here to help maintain a pleasant gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

These are pieces of information that we suggest you research before you
begin game play.  You can read this page at the game prompt by typing 'info'.

1.  All the basic information we think you need to play the game is 
    available through the HELP command. Type HELP by itself to see a list
    of topics which can then be read with the HELP command.

2.  You must read the disclaimer by typing HELP DISCLAIMER. You should
    also read the rules by typing HELP RULES.
    ***WARNING:  IGNORANCE IS NO DEFENSE ***

3.  New players should read HELP NEWBIE. Then read all the topics it points
    you to. Even old players can probably learn a few things here.

The roads are long and tiring, be prepared.  The game is designed for
experienced MUD players; it is full of subtle dangers, so keep your

game -- we have done our best to accommodate you as well.

"Life is dangerous, Caramon. Just stepping out that door is dangerous! You

window, comes with the handshake of a stranger. If we stop living because
we fear death, then we have already died."

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

[36mNowhere[0;37m
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name.

    The bough of this vallenwood narrows as it extends further south. A
school for budding warriors lies to the west while a clearing on a junction
of boughs can be seen to the east. You have a strange feeling that you are
being watched especially since the thick vallenwood canopy provides
excellent hiding spots for those skilled in being unseen. The trunk of this
massive vallenwood lies back to the north, and can be reached easily by the
footholds and handholds in the bough leading down.

some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and

foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    Water trickles down the middle of the tunnel, heading east as the
tunnel begins to slope downward. The air is quite stagnant, having no
discernable breeze. There are a combination of musty and rank smells which
overpower the senses. Barely perceptible, a small fire smolders at the
bend in the tunnel.

    Echoes bounce off the tunnel walls from indiscernible directions. A

clear the area. Small puddles of water checker the floor with an occasional
drop from the ceiling adding to the cacophony of the tunnel.

    This is the Solace Dump. It is basically a huge sinkhole which is
filled with trash and other odds and ends. The smell is quite horrible. The
thick foliage around the edge of the dump is effective in keeping the smell
and sight of the dump isolated from the rest of Solace. A small path leads
north. A large sewer grate, which is perpetually open, allows access to the
sewers below.

a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and

foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

[36mA Dark Tunnel[0;37m
    Echoes bounce off the tunnel walls from indiscernible directions. A
combination of scratching, rustling, skittering and dripping noises can be
heard. The air remains fetid and feculent without significant airflow to
clear the area. Small puddles of water checker the floor with an occasional
drop from the ceiling adding to the cacophony of the tunnel.

[36mA Bend in the Tunnel[0;37m
    At this bend in the sewer tunnels, passage to the north and west is
possible. The dark tunnels appear to go on forever and stagnant air makes
it difficult to breath. The area appears well-travelled, though, so as
difficult as breath is to come by, the conditions must be far from deadly.

    The stone sewer tunnels continue to the east and west of here. A slight
breeze can be felt to the west which also dilutes the horrific smell of the
place. Skittering noises can be heard in the shadows near the base of the
tunnel. The passageway is clear of significant debris and has likely been
cleared by recent rainfall.

    At this bend in the sewer tunnels, passage to the north and west is
possible. The dark tunnels appear to go on forever and stagnant air makes
it difficult to breath. The area appears well-travelled, though, so as
difficult as breath is to come by, the conditions must be far from deadly.

    This magic shop is an old and dusty place. Shelves and cases line the
walls and fill the room. Scrolls, books, wands, staves, and all sorts of
magical paraphernalia is on display. The shades on the windows let in stray
rays of light which streak through the dust filled air, making slashes
across the dim room. A faint smell of incense fills the air and you hear
chimes tinkling in the distance. A set of spiral staircase carved into the
tree leads down. The center of the tree can be accessed through a door to
the west.
