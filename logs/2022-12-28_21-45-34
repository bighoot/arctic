[36mThe Burrow[0;37m
    A small humble inn, the Burrow offers a comfortable bed and even a
hearty meal to its patrons. A fire burns brightly inside a fireplace carved
straight out of the mountain; its shaft leading all the way out. Long
tables with patrons enjoying dinner and a comfortable sofa at the eastern
end of the room are the primary elements of furniture. A door on the
western end of the burrow must lead to the private customer rooms. On the
northern wall of the Burrow is a small stage, where some musicians and
entertainers try to earn their way to a bed. Various tables have been set
up around the stage, but the customers here are very quiet and pleasant,
compared to the more raucous group above. A stairway to Binar's Bar is up
against the southern wall; this is the only direction out of the inn.

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

    Fabulous aromas assault the senses from all sides of this compact
kitchen. Over the fire-pit a huge pig is roasting slowly, while at the
stove bread bakes to a fine golden brown. A bookshelf on the southern wall
holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a
priest of Reorx. A window set on the northern wall is open, in the
unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,
while the backdoor of the Burrow is framed near the window.

signifying a regularly boisterous patronage. The tunnel extending from this

    Dark gray walls climb to the ceiling of this massive stalagmite.
Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural
wonderland.

    On both sides of a long dried path are huge puddles of a strangely
sweet-smelling mud. Thankfully, the path provides relief from the messy
mud-covered entrance of the stalagmite. Cloved prints pockmark the path,
too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room. The
path leads to the south and north, where a sickening smell seems to be
coming from.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

    Viscous streams of the sweet-smelling, orange-tan mud spills forth from
an unseen source above. The result is an absolutely absurd amount of mud in
this room. Looking down, huge body prints have been cast where armaboros
have spent their time recuperating energy. The path to the west looks a
little bit easier to move in, since, here, you are forced to swim.

[36mA Hot, Muddy Spring[0;37m
    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area
below.

[36mA Hot, Muddy Spring[0;37m
    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area
below.

    Viscous streams of the sweet-smelling, orange-tan mud spills forth from
an unseen source above. The result is an absolutely absurd amount of mud in
this room. Looking down, huge body prints have been cast where armaboros
have spent their time recuperating energy. The path to the west looks a

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small

the den of the armaboros. The bodyprints in this area suggest that it is an

congregate in this area, male armaboros, with breeding rights, will come

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural

    The walls in this portion of the stalagmite are very different from
those previously encountered. There are no smooth curves, bumps, or odd
colors. Coffee-colored walls surround this small cavern and capture the
moist air and smells that waft in from other areas of the stalagmite. This
bubble in the stalagmite appears to contain less moisture than the other
ones, but it still has collected several small puddles on the floor. Cloved
hoofprints can be found all over, none leading in any particular direction.

    The walls in this portion of the stalagmite are very different from
those previously encountered. There are no smooth curves, bumps, or odd
colors. Coffee-colored walls surround this small cavern and capture the
moist air and smells that waft in from other areas of the stalagmite. This
bubble in the stalagmite appears to contain less moisture than the other
ones, but it still has collected several small puddles on the floor. Cloved
hoofprints can be found all over, none leading in any particular direction.
The stalagmite continues to the south.

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural
wonderland.

Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side

[36mBefore a Humble Inn[0;37m
    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

[36mJunction One[0;37m
    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

bring an abundance of light to this underground tunnel.

    A remarkably sparkly chandelier adds pleasant luminescence to the room.
Instead of glass dangling down from it, fiery rubies glitter adding a red
tinge to the light of the chandelier. Against the northern wall of the
shop, a full smithy is set up. Apprentice and veteran smiths seem to use
it, both to manufacture products for the shop, as well as larger orders for
King Torak and King Hornfel. The western wall has a large area devoted to
ornamental additions to the smithed products as well as weaving stations
and strange gadgets. On the southern wall a large counter is set up as a
payment station, there is also a large exchange box on it. Strange
underground plants hang down from the ceiling. It seems like this ancient
store really sells just about anything a villager would need.

into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift

exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

    The rocky bend in the mountains is a sort of valley as the taller
mountain peaks all around slope downward. Loose boulders above give an
uneasy feeling, as the mountains funnel to this portion of the road. The
only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs
are unscalable. An indication of civilization comes in the form of a thin
netting that sits along the sloped cliffside to the west, preventing much
of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such
netting to the south.

the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.

[36mA Highway Through the Plains[0;37m
    Winding its way through the windy and fertile Plains, the highway
stretches to the east and to the west, escaping the horizon. Quiet and
depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the highway, their
heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the
highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and weeds.
The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire, and to the
west you can see the mighty Vingaard River.

    A highway runs through the Solamnic Plain, alongside the Vingaard
River as it makes its way northward. The road is rutted and looks to have
been heavily traveled, though a few weeds seem to be popping up. A small
covered area lies off the road for those waiting for the ferry, and a small
dock juts out into the river for the ferry itself.

    The clear waters of the Vingaard River gently flow northward, toward
Kalaman and the Northern Courrain Ocean. The river is fairly wide though
seems a bit narrower in this area, likely the reason a ferry was set up
here. Light shimmers off the water, dancing about the irregularities in the
water's usually smooth surface. A few fish can barely be seen swimming
about.

walls run north and south from here, extending quite a ways before turning
beyond your vision. A stone highway leads east through the Solamnic plains
and a cobblestone avenue heads west through the gates.

traffic passes through the area, and the proximity to the river moistens
the ground. To the west lies a small tollhouse, used in days past to
collect taxes from travellers passing through. Northward the road heads to
the east gate of Vingaard City, and to a ferry crossing the river.

Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

[36mThe West Bank[0;37m
    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

[36mFording the Vingaard River[0;37m
    The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal
place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,
scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from

    A dampness fills the air and a light breeze blows the scent of salt to
you from the north. In between the infrequent breezes and the smell of
salt, another odor reaches you. This one however is overpoweringly foul and
rank. Garbage is strewn about here and there and you see a few footprints
on the ground. The tunnel continues on to the north and south off into the
darkness. The walls and ceiling are shored up by stone archways that were
built every fifteen feet or so. A stone sconce sits on both sides of the
tunnel walls, the torches in them burnt out ages ago. Puddles of dank and
stagnant water sit in depressions in the floor, continuously filled by
drips from above.

[36mThe Palanthas Sewers[0;37m
    An odor so foul it seems to have a life of its own hits you from all
directions. Garbage is strewn about in piles, probably dumped by citizens
passing overhead. Puddles of dank and stagnant water sit in depressions in
the floor. The sewer tunnel leads east and west here. Above you is a sewer
grate. The floor appears to run straight and level off in both directions,
with footprints scattered about here and there. The walls are made of stone
blocks, cemented together at the joints.

    Two tunnels intersect at this point, or used to. The tunnel
continuation to the east has collapsed onto itself. Another sewer tunnel
leads off to the south. The tunnel is made of large stone blocks that fit
together perfectly at the seams. The workmanship looks to be dwarven, but
it's quite ancient. The walls are now covered in dirt and grime and have
some scratch marks on them. Garbage sits in piles on the floor amid pools
of stagnant, foul smelling water. Some water drips onto your head from a
sewer grate in the ceiling, perhaps a chance for some fresh air.

[36mThe Guild Hall[0;37m
    The main room of the guild hall continues to the east, south and
southeast. A stage sits near the western wall, where thieves can
demonstrate a new technique they may have picked up. Near the stage is a
doorway leading to the west, above it is a small sign that merely says
'Training'. Off to the north is a smaller room that appears to be a shop of
some kind. Some tables have been placed in this section of the warehouse
for guild members to sit and have a few drinks. The ones that are not too
drunk quickly stand up and make threatening gestures.

[36mThieves' Training Room[0;37m
    This room appears to be the first part in a series of training rooms
for thieves. A sign is on the northern wall and doorways are in the eastern
and western walls. Scattered about the room are dummies for thieves to
practice their skills on, and some chests sitting in a corner of the room.
Some of the dummies appear to be backstab targets and have target marks on
them, others are covered with small bells for thieving practice. Parts of
the room are covered with dirt and leaves for reading tracks and the like.

practice their skills on, and some chests sitting in a corner of the room.
Some of the dummies appear to be backstab targets and have target marks on
them, others are covered with small bells for thieving practice. Parts of
the room are covered with dirt and leaves for reading tracks and the like.

    The main room of the guild hall continues to the east, south and
southeast. A stage sits near the western wall, where thieves can
demonstrate a new technique they may have picked up. Near the stage is a
doorway leading to the west, above it is a small sign that merely says
'Training'. Off to the north is a smaller room that appears to be a shop of
some kind. Some tables have been placed in this section of the warehouse
for guild members to sit and have a few drinks. The ones that are not too
drunk quickly stand up and make threatening gestures.

have been placed around this section of the warehouse for the guild members

faithful stand on the walls, the tower shall not fall. Eastwards lies a

    Directly to the north, the High Clerist Tower rises skyward, reaching
higher than any other structure on Krynn. The tower, an ancient bastion of
the Solamnic Knighthood, stands just to the side of Westgate pass. The
Knight's Spur, a much more recent addition, stretches out across the
northern exit of the pass, protecting the city of Palanthas that lies
beyond. A few snow-capped peaks of the Vingaard Mountains can be seen in
the distance, their impressive heights dwarfed by the massive tower. To the
south, the road leads back down to the plains through the mountains.

    This well traveled road gently winds its way up the Vingaard Mountains,
hugging the edges of the mountainsides. The area is fairly rocky, but there
are some small patches of trees here and there, a bit of snow still hanging
on their branches. A few hearty birds remain despite the cold, their song
clear in the crisp air. The road begins to climb a bit more rapidly as it
heads northward, while it gently slopes down to the east.

branches swaying gently in the light breeze that blows. Looking west to the

between the Vingaard Mountains and the Virkhus Hills.

their tops back and forth. A large bird occasionally flies by high
overhead, searching for prey. The road stretches east and west through the

[36mThe Ferry Landing[0;37m
    A small building has been built here, just north of the road. The
building is apparently there as a living area for the ferry's operators. A
small section of the building's roof extends out over the road to serve as
a place of waiting for the ferry. A small dock juts out into the flowing
waters of the Vingaard, a series of cleats along its edges to tie up the
ferry.

    The clear waters of the Vingaard River gently flow northward, toward
Kalaman and the Northern Courrain Ocean. The river is fairly wide though
seems a bit narrower in this area, likely the reason a ferry was set up
here. Light shimmers off the water, dancing about the irregularities in the
water's usually smooth surface. A few fish can barely be seen swimming
about.

dock juts out into the river for the ferry itself.

[36mCurving Away from the Shore[0;37m
    The trail here heads towards the shoreline of the river, and into the
plains south of here. The river stretches out a little ways north of you as
it makes its way to the sea. The grasses here are sparse and mixed in with
sandy dunes. Scattered among the dunes are pieces of driftwood that have
been washed up over the years from storms off the ocean.

is a crow or perhaps some other bird. Other than that you can't hear any
other sounds of wildlife. The road continues on to the north and south
through the Khalkist foothills.

that each passes through the barren Khalkist foothills, which spread all

    What road there is disappears in the drifting volcanic ash, so that to
the north only a path remains. To the south, a poorly visible road hugs the
side of the volcano, curving out of sight. The air is smoky, and every now

    The road cuts through the mighty Khalkists, covered in the prints of
many boots. The road leads north past the heart of the Khalkists and south
towards the dark city of Neraka. The mountain range looms high above,
craggy and barren. Birds of prey can be seen hovering above, waiting for
the carnage of war. The air is filled with a thick film, possibly coming
from one of the semi-active volcanoes in the region.

    The dark city of Neraka spreads out to the south, the dark minions of
Takhisis filling the streets. A twisted dark spire rises in the middle of
the city, the pinnacle of the Queen's temple. The craggy peaks of the
Khalkist mountains rise around the city, adding their shadows to the film
of ash that floats through the air.

[36mA Cobbled Path[0;37m
    Cowering in the shadows of the black city walls, this cobbled path is
almost completely lost in shadow. The roughly hewn cobbles are covered with
filth and trash, and the path probably hasn't been cleaned in months. More
care has been taken in hewing the stones used to make the massive walls,
clearly showing where the city's priorities lie. A dreary gloom hangs over
the area, and it would be unwise to linger here longer than necessary. The
dirty cobblestone path continues to the east and west, while an ominously
narrow passage between the looming walls leads to the south from here. Off
to the north, a rocky path leads into the mighty Khalkist mountains.

[36mThe Main Gates of Neraka[0;37m
    The ominous black stones of the city walls press in close, creating a
killing zone in front of the terrifying main gates of Neraka. The gates are
forged from solid steel and adorned with stylized golden sculptures of the
Dark Queen -- as the warrior and as the seductress. The massive gates stand
guard beneath a foreboding archway, and a life-like stone sculpture of the
five-headed dragon perches protectively over the gates. The dragon's heads
seem to be moving, but that is probably just a trick of the shadows.

[36mThe Emperor's Court[0;37m
    Opulent black and gold pennants hang from the stone walls surrounding
this ominous courtyard. A golden throne sits upon a dais at the eastern end
of the courtyard, and there is enough space for a couple hundred troops to
line up before it. The ostentatious decorations have clearly been designed
to instill visitors with a sense of awe, but everything looks a bit small,
as if the architect was told to exercise moderation and didn't know how. A
pair of cruel black gates stand at the northern end of the courtyard, while
a spacious stone passageway leads off to the south. Beyond the west end of
the courtyard lies a broad lane and the dolorous milieu of the dark city.

[36mA Spacious Stone Passageway[0;37m
    Formed from gigantic blocks of black granite, this spacious passageway
is wide enough across for twenty men to walk abreast. The giant stones arch
high overhead, yet the space feels somewhat claustrophobic. The passageway
acts as a link between courtyards to the north and south, and from here it
is obvious that the Emperor's Court to the north is gaudier, but less grand
than the magnificent and terrible Queen's Court that lies to the south.

    This vast, open courtyard is large enough to hold thousands of people
and is an excellent place for the dark pilgrims to gather an audience for
mass prayers or public executions. The west end of the court is dominated
by a raised platform where such spectacles can be staged in full view of
the citizenry, and a five-headed dragon has been carved on the wall behind
it. This courtyard somehow manages to be both magnificent and terrible at
the same time. Twisted black gates stand guard to the south while a
spacious stone passageway lies to the north. A wide lane begins at the base
of the platform and leads east into the dismal melee of the city.

    This vast, open courtyard is large enough to hold thousands of people
and is an excellent place for the dark pilgrims to gather an audience for
mass prayers or public executions. The west end of the court is dominated
by a raised platform where such spectacles can be staged in full view of
the citizenry, and a five-headed dragon has been carved on the wall behind
it. This courtyard somehow manages to be both magnificent and terrible at
the same time. Twisted black gates stand guard to the south while a
spacious stone passageway lies to the north. A wide lane begins at the base
of the platform and leads east into the dismal melee of the city.

    The large common room of this popular inn functions as a restaurant and
tavern. Delicious smells drift out of the busy kitchen, and cold ale flows
freely from the taps behind the oaken bar. Most of the space is occupied by
three long tables shared by all of the inn's patrons, but there are also a
few smaller tables hiding in some of the shadowy corners. A broad staircase
leads to the upper floors of the building, where the sleeping rooms lie.

freely from the taps behind the oaken bar. Most of the space is occupied by
three long tables shared by all of the inn's patrons, but there are also a
few smaller tables hiding in some of the shadowy corners. A broad staircase
leads to the upper floors of the building, where the sleeping rooms lie.

    The rocky bend in the mountains is a sort of valley as the taller
mountain peaks all around slope downward. Loose boulders above give an
uneasy feeling, as the mountains funnel to this portion of the road. The
only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs
are unscalable. An indication of civilization comes in the form of a thin
netting that sits along the sloped cliffside to the west, preventing much
of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such
netting to the south.

    This large road, composed mostly of dry, dusty dirt, winds its way
across the parched yellow grasses of the plains towards Delphon to the
west, and to a crossroad east of here. The wind carries with it the sounds
of Delphon, a large city whose towering black gates glitter in both
darkness and light. Many travelers pass you by, most heading west towards
the great city of Delphon or beginning the trek to Port Balifor which rests
southeast of here, along the shores of the Khurman Sea. The breeze dies

of which the road is made is cracked and dry with lack of moisture, and
very few plants other than the occasional cactus dare grow in such a trying

    Dry, yellow, parched grasses expand all around you. Hot winds goad the
few trees that brave the heat of the relentless summer suns, and several
travelers rest in the shade of these large hardwoods. You can see the
sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south, and the smell of the sea is
strong in the air, the glittering, placid waters of the Bay of Balifor
being visible to the west.  Curving north and to the west, the dusty
road continues along the rolling plains.

the docks. The presence of the men of the Watch is much higher here than
around the rest of the docks. As you look down the pier to the west, you
catch a glimpse of a huge old sailing ship, which has absolutely no traffic
going to and from it.

[36mBefore These Crowded Streets[0;37m
    The fabled docks of the city of Port Balifor stretch to the north from
this point. As people move back and forth around you, you decide that
moving is probably safer than standing still in the middle of the great
crowd. This mass of people prevents you from seeing the northern end of the
docks, but it does not prevent you from taking in an awesome view of the
Bay of Balifor to the west.

can be seen roaming and darting through the shallow waters below through
drifting seaweed. To the east stand the dockyards of Port Balifor, with the
bay stretching out to the west and south.

stored here was slaves.  Blood and water mixed together flows back and

[36mThe Burrow[0;37m
    A small humble inn, the Burrow offers a comfortable bed and even a
hearty meal to its patrons. A fire burns brightly inside a fireplace carved
straight out of the mountain; its shaft leading all the way out. Long
tables with patrons enjoying dinner and a comfortable sofa at the eastern
end of the room are the primary elements of furniture. A door on the
western end of the burrow must lead to the private customer rooms. On the
northern wall of the Burrow is a small stage, where some musicians and
entertainers try to earn their way to a bed. Various tables have been set
up around the stage, but the customers here are very quiet and pleasant,
compared to the more raucous group above. A stairway to Binar's Bar is up
against the southern wall; this is the only direction out of the inn.

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

stove bread bakes to a fine golden brown. A bookshelf on the southern wall
holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a
priest of Reorx. A window set on the northern wall is open, in the
unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,

    You have sunk even deeper into the great ocean. The once-bright
sunlight from the surface world has been filtered out by the water to
almost nothing, and the faint glow which remains leaves much to the
imagination. You can just make out several long ropy plants drifting past.
Above, the ocean brightens into a circle of blue light, and below it fades
into total darkness. All around you the faint haze continues, and you think
you can see several large shapes moving through the water.

    This is the middle of the former main street of great Lemuria. You can
feel the eyes of the ghosts of the proud Lemurians upon you as you wander
through their city. You feel very much the intruder as you gaze upon the
fantastic architecture; more fabulous and more beautiful than anything
produced by the greatest masters of Krynn. To the north and west the main
street continues, while to the east and south there are buildings which
seem to have once served important government functions.

exotic animals; strange smells coming from the great kitchens. And then
it's gone, and all that remains is the empty street, dark and bleary,
covered with the great weight of the endless ocean above. A passing eddy of
current briefly stirs up a bit of muck from the ocean floor, and then all
is still again. An alley of some kind lies to the west, and the main street

    You are on the mighty main street of Lemuria, right next to the great

clicking and creaking noises which might be creatures of the deep, but just
don't quite sound right for that. To the north and south the main street
continues, and east of here lies a city gate.

feel the eyes of the ghosts of the proud Lemurians upon you as you wander
through their city. You feel very much the intruder as you gaze upon the
fantastic architecture; more fabulous and more beautiful than anything
produced by the greatest masters of Krynn. To the north and west the main
street continues, while to the east and south there are buildings which
seem to have once served important government functions.

    Apparently the Lemurian kings, like all great monarchs, valued their
own safety enough to install this secret exit to the palace. There is a
long shaft leading up here, with a ladder on its side. It is a testament to
the skill of the builders of the palace that this room has remained
airtight through the ages the palace has been underwater. Even after your
entrance, it remains free of the salty seawater that has flooded the rest
of the city, protected by some unseen force.

[36mThe Burrow[0;37m
    A small humble inn, the Burrow offers a comfortable bed and even a
hearty meal to its patrons. A fire burns brightly inside a fireplace carved
straight out of the mountain; its shaft leading all the way out. Long
tables with patrons enjoying dinner and a comfortable sofa at the eastern
end of the room are the primary elements of furniture. A door on the
western end of the burrow must lead to the private customer rooms. On the
northern wall of the Burrow is a small stage, where some musicians and
entertainers try to earn their way to a bed. Various tables have been set
up around the stage, but the customers here are very quiet and pleasant,
compared to the more raucous group above. A stairway to Binar's Bar is up
against the southern wall; this is the only direction out of the inn.

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

    A big rock protrudes out of the ground here, forcing you to dodge
around it as you walk down the path. Huge stalagmites rising out of the
ground obstruct passage to the west and south. Instead, they lead the path
to the north and east. Some small colonies of lichen seem to have developed
a taste for the stalagmites as a home, as they have begun to grow in the
cracks.

    Colonies of lichen have infiltrated the cracks of large stalagmites
that surround the path here. These stalagmites force the road to the west
and south, but block progress to both the east and north. Far to the south
a shadow from a particularly large stalagmite has been cast over the area.
Some strange hoof-like footprints have been left in the ground here. Most
of the hoofprints lead to the south.

    The long road through the stalagmite fields comes to an abrupt end at
the base of an incredibly large stalagmite. Deep grooves along the length
of the monolith are filled with colonies of subterranean lichens. In the
road some strange hoof-like footprints have been left. They seem to lead
right into the stalagmite. The road through the stalagmite fields leads to

    Dark gray walls climb to the ceiling of this massive stalagmite.
Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural

    The walls in this portion of the stalagmite are very different from
those previously encountered. There are no smooth curves, bumps, or odd
colors. Coffee-colored walls surround this small cavern and capture the
moist air and smells that waft in from other areas of the stalagmite. This
bubble in the stalagmite appears to contain less moisture than the other
ones, but it still has collected several small puddles on the floor. Cloved
hoofprints can be found all over, none leading in any particular direction.

[36mInside a Huge Stalagmite[0;37m
    The walls in this portion of the stalagmite are very different from
those previously encountered. There are no smooth curves, bumps, or odd
colors. Coffee-colored walls surround this small cavern and capture the
moist air and smells that waft in from other areas of the stalagmite. This
bubble in the stalagmite appears to contain less moisture than the other
ones, but it still has collected several small puddles on the floor. Cloved
hoofprints can be found all over, none leading in any particular direction.
The stalagmite continues to the south.

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural
wonderland.

too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small

    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem

of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the

unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,
while the backdoor of the Burrow is framed near the window.

Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large

    Near the ceiling of the tunnel, bright torches are mounted to light the
area. The central passage of the tunnel is ridden with tread marks for
mining carts, which pass by: sometimes relaxedly and sometimes with
reckless abandon. Many dwarves of the village walk on the sides of the
tunnel. From the west interesting smells of smithing and other manufactured
goods waft into the room. To the east and south the Main Way continues.

    A clear junction spot of the Main Way, the area is labeled with a huge

the north and west, clearly paths for mining carts along the Main Way.
Surprisingly, the tunnel east, while plenty big enough for the carts, has
no tracks leading in that direction. Villagers are plentiful in the area of
this junction, some chatting wildly with each other, while others sit on
the benches, which have been erected around the junction sign. Torches
bring an abundance of light to this underground tunnel.

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

    The rocky bend in the mountains is a sort of valley as the taller
mountain peaks all around slope downward. Loose boulders above give an
uneasy feeling, as the mountains funnel to this portion of the road. The
only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs
are unscalable. An indication of civilization comes in the form of a thin
netting that sits along the sloped cliffside to the west, preventing much
of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such
netting to the south.

    You arrive upon a three way crossroads in the foothills of the
Khalkists. As you examine the three different directions, you only notice
that each passes through the barren Khalkist foothills, which spread all
around you. Other than these foothills, you are only able to make out some
large mountains in each direction which further block your view of anything
beyond them.

Perhaps you can get a ride across the river on it. Leading away from the

    The highway runs alongside the west bank of the Vingaard River, below
the high walls of the city itself. The road is heavily rutted as much
traffic passes through the area, and the proximity to the river moistens
the ground. To the west lies a small tollhouse, used in days past to
collect taxes from travellers passing through. Northward the road heads to
the east gate of Vingaard City, and to a ferry crossing the river.

    The Que Kul are one of the many plainsman tribes of Krynn. Most of
their brethren made their homes near the towering vallenwoods of Solace,
but the Que Kul saw no room for themselves, so they packed up their things
and made the long journey to the Solamnic Plains where they carved out
their own home from the unyielding grasses. They are a peaceful tribe, only
really known among the people of Palanthas and Kalaman. They have been
known to help those who were beset by forces of the dragonarmy while
travelling the plains. As you stare at all the huts of this crude village,
you can't help but admire the courage they must have to live out here
denying the protection of the major cities, and instead choosing to battle
the dragonarmies on their own land. Looking at the size of this village,
you can't help but wonder how they managed to keep it so secluded from the
populace.

the north, while the path east leads towards the highway through the
plains.

    The trail dips down slightly and the tall grasses rise once again,
obscuring all directions. A turn in the trail turns from its north and
south directions, leading west through the reeds. Although there is nothing
of significance directly visible, clouds of smoke rising from the north
indicate that there is shelter nearby.

through some grasses, as well as north towards the unknown village.

legs have become very tired from your walk through the plains and you move
along slowly, thankful only that the path has become much better kept and
easier to move through. Whatever you're looking for out here, it looks like
it probably lies to the north. To the east, the trail makes another turn.

    The aroma of meats cooking over a fire is strong enough to cause any
creature to salivate. The smell wafts in from the north, where a worn path
can be seen taking a turn through the reeds. The reeds and grasses
themselves grow too tall for you to see past. Although the region is mostly
dry, the ground is soft and squishy and suggests the presence of water
nearby. The sound of rushing water seems to confirm that notion.

make out the tantalizing aroma of cook fire. Somewhere off to the east, the
flowing of a fast river floats to your ears. To the south, the small path
leads a short ways to the Solamnic Highway.

    Winding its way through the windy and fertile Plains, the highway
stretches to the east and to the west, escaping the horizon. Quiet and
depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the highway, their
heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the
highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and weeds.
The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire, and to the
west you can see the mighty Vingaard River.

Kalaman and the Northern Courrain Ocean. The river is fairly wide though
seems a bit narrower in this area, likely the reason a ferry was set up
here. Light shimmers off the water, dancing about the irregularities in the
water's usually smooth surface. A few fish can barely be seen swimming
about.

    A small building has been built here, just north of the road. The
building is apparently there as a living area for the ferry's operators. A
small section of the building's roof extends out over the road to serve as
a place of waiting for the ferry. A small dock juts out into the flowing
waters of the Vingaard, a series of cleats along its edges to tie up the
ferry.

between the Vingaard Mountains and the Virkhus Hills.

    Directly to the north, the High Clerist Tower rises skyward, reaching
higher than any other structure on Krynn. The tower, an ancient bastion of
the Solamnic Knighthood, stands just to the side of Westgate pass. The
Knight's Spur, a much more recent addition, stretches out across the
northern exit of the pass, protecting the city of Palanthas that lies
beyond. A few snow-capped peaks of the Vingaard Mountains can be seen in
the distance, their impressive heights dwarfed by the massive tower. To the
south, the road leads back down to the plains through the mountains.

monument to the left is of a solitary man, his face shrouded by his cloak,
leaning gently on a walking staff. A small owl is perched on his right
shoulder. The monument to the right looks to be a simple block of granite,
but you sense it is more than that. Stepping closer, you see what appear to
be shatter marks in the otherwise pristine stone. Laying atop the granite
block is what appears to be a mold for the blade and hilt of a sword. The
trees and grass here is severely overgrown, making you wonder when the last
time someone was through this area.

It doesn't take long to realize you are atop a cliff, though its edge is

feel a sense of wariness, you cannot locate the source of your discomfort

     As you suspected earlier the cliff drops off into a small valley, but
that supposition couldn't have prepared you for what lies within that
valley. Jutting out from beneath the far wall of the valley is the edge of
a building, made from the same stone as the valley walls. You suspect that
it goes much further into the wall, but can't be sure from this distance.
Lying between you and that building is a large field, which looks as though
a war once raged upon it. There are signs of a barricade to your right, a
rock slide to the left, and various pits and traps in between. With sudden
abruptness you realize you are standing on the cliff the young druid
sacrificed his life upon in a final spell to end the Celestial War. Surely

[36mExit from the Celestial Valley[0;37m
     Almost as your feet touch the floor of the valley, you feel the air
begin to weigh heavily in your lungs. The odor of centuries old magic and
decades old battles hangs around you like an oppressive blanket. The ground
beneath your feet is a lifeless color, everything that once grew here
having been crushed into oblivion under soldiers' feet years earlier. As
you shuffle your feet to get a better look around, the dust you kick up
begins to mix with the death in the air. The valley walls block your exit
to the west, but the field of battle continues to the east and north. There
appears to be a crystal block immediately north.

    The crystal block you saw from further away is clearly a monument, but
who originally erected it is a mystery. It appears to be made from solid
red crystal, at least on this side. As you run your hands along the almost
frictionless surface, you discover that the block turns to granite halfway
along each side. Gazing atop the statue, you see the figure of a large
Aurinite knight, his shield and sword resting against on the ground before
him, staring passionless at the valley wall. There looks to be a second
figure standing back-to-back with the Aurinite, but you can't tell from
this side. Nor can you easily go around the statue as it takes up the
entire area immediately to the east.

     Something died here, of that there can be little doubt. But you are
just as certain it wasn't one of the Aurinites or Gargoyles. The crevasse
made by the body is far too big to be a soldier, even one of their massive
sizes. It becomes immediately apparent that some kind of large dragon died
here, at least that is the impression you get from examining the crevasse.
What happened to the body and who killed it are questions you don't have
answers for, but at least you now have a glimpse of the killing power of
the Aurinite and Gargoyle armies.

     Though there are no bodies, bones, or traces of blood here, it is
clear the Celestial War once raged across this area of the valley. Pieces
of equipment, weapons, and armour covered with years of dust and decay
litter the floor. None appear to be in any condition that would make them
valuable, even as souvenirs of the war. Judging from the few tracks you can
still see on the ground and the collection of equipment nearby, the battle
that occurred here obviously spilled over into the areas to the south and
west. You can't help wonder what happened to the victims this equipment
once protected from harm.

     Remarkably this small area of the valley appears to have been spared
the ravages the rest of the valley suffered. There is no debris from
equipment or weapons, no signs of any scuffles, and no bodies within sight.
It immediately seems strange to you that this single area was saved from
the Celestial War, but then you notice the faint marks along the ground.
Upon closer examination, they vaguely resemble the marks a broom with stiff
bristles might leave if it were used to sweep the area. It is with some
hesitation you admit to yourself that somebody deliberately cleaned this
area of the valley, though for what reason you can only guess.

     The rock slide you saw from the cliff above the valley, the one that
jutted out from the west wall, comes to an end here, allowing you easy
access to the north again. There is no sign what caused the rock slide this
far from the wall, but it feels unnatural even from this distance. Whatever
force buried the Celestial Temple beneath the valley walls probably
inadvertently caused this rock slide as well. Though you can travel to the
north, west, and south from here, the area immediately to your east has
been cut off by a large pit. Glancing down into the pit you see a
collection of pointed spears, but there are no bodies on the spears
indicating it was ever successfully used.

battle field holds the same signs of the war that plagued the rest of the
valley. There are broken swords, rusted out piece of armour, and various
other pieces of equipment badly in need of repairs. But the war remains
seem deliberately sorted into piles of similar items. Weapons have been
sorted from armour and clothing. By the amount of dust that has collected
on the piles, you guess that whoever did this did so shortly after the war
ended and then left them here unattended.

It takes you a moment to realize what it is, and a moment longer for the
oppressive dust to settle. This area of the valley has been thoroughly
cleaned of the remains from the Celestial War. There are no signs of broken
equipment or weaponry. The ground even seems to have been well swept to
clear the excess rubble caused from the rock slide.

immediately drawn to one small item in the valley floor. The area has been
completely cleared of all equipment and weapons that might have been left
from the Celestial War, and the ground has been swept clean. What makes
this area truly spectacular is the single flower someone has planted in the
ground. You almost feel as though someone has begun to restore the valley
to the condition it was before the war ravaged it. As you marvel at the
single flower, you notice a dull white fence to the north and beyond it
what appears to be tombstones.

bolt strikes given the pattern of them. You find that your attention is
drawn away from the rock slide and to the north, though. A large gate made
of white metal stands before you. A sign hangs on the side of the gate, but
it is in a language you do not understand. Looking through the gate and
seeing what's there, you can't help but feel it reads "Cemetery."

protecting this area. He is clean shaven with dark hair, ice blue eyes, and
a posture more rigid than a sword. His feet are covered with a pair of
sandals, which have golden laces strung through them. There can be little

Temple.

     The rock slide that spilled into the valley obviously started from
this place, but the disaster looks anything but natural. There are clear
signs from this angle of an explosion, apparently from multiple lightning
bolt strikes given the pattern of them. You find that your attention is
drawn away from the rock slide and to the north, though. A large gate made
of white metal stands before you. A sign hangs on the side of the gate, but
it is in a language you do not understand. Looking through the gate and
seeing what's there, you can't help but feel it reads "Cemetery."

     Although the rock slide continues to the south here, your attention is
immediately drawn to one small item in the valley floor. The area has been
completely cleared of all equipment and weapons that might have been left
from the Celestial War, and the ground has been swept clean. What makes
this area truly spectacular is the single flower someone has planted in the
ground. You almost feel as though someone has begun to restore the valley
to the condition it was before the war ravaged it. As you marvel at the
single flower, you notice a dull white fence to the north and beyond it
what appears to be tombstones.

     Taking up the expanse of land immediately to the south and obscuring

It takes you a moment to realize what it is, and a moment longer for the
oppressive dust to settle. This area of the valley has been thoroughly
cleaned of the remains from the Celestial War. There are no signs of broken
equipment or weaponry. The ground even seems to have been well swept to
clear the excess rubble caused from the rock slide.

     The rock slide you saw from the edge of the valley ends here, but it
isn't the mass of stone that captures your attention. This area of the
battle field holds the same signs of the war that plagued the rest of the
valley. There are broken swords, rusted out piece of armour, and various
other pieces of equipment badly in need of repairs. But the war remains
seem deliberately sorted into piles of similar items. Weapons have been
sorted from armour and clothing. By the amount of dust that has collected
on the piles, you guess that whoever did this did so shortly after the war
ended and then left them here unattended.

     The rock slide you saw from the cliff above the valley, the one that
jutted out from the west wall, comes to an end here, allowing you easy
access to the north again. There is no sign what caused the rock slide this
far from the wall, but it feels unnatural even from this distance. Whatever
force buried the Celestial Temple beneath the valley walls probably
inadvertently caused this rock slide as well. Though you can travel to the
north, west, and south from here, the area immediately to your east has
been cut off by a large pit. Glancing down into the pit you see a
collection of pointed spears, but there are no bodies on the spears
indicating it was ever successfully used.

     Remarkably this small area of the valley appears to have been spared
the ravages the rest of the valley suffered. There is no debris from
equipment or weapons, no signs of any scuffles, and no bodies within sight.
It immediately seems strange to you that this single area was saved from
the Celestial War, but then you notice the faint marks along the ground.
Upon closer examination, they vaguely resemble the marks a broom with stiff
bristles might leave if it were used to sweep the area. It is with some
hesitation you admit to yourself that somebody deliberately cleaned this
area of the valley, though for what reason you can only guess.

     Though there are no bodies, bones, or traces of blood here, it is
clear the Celestial War once raged across this area of the valley. Pieces
of equipment, weapons, and armour covered with years of dust and decay
litter the floor. None appear to be in any condition that would make them
valuable, even as souvenirs of the war. Judging from the few tracks you can
still see on the ground and the collection of equipment nearby, the battle
that occurred here obviously spilled over into the areas to the south and
west. You can't help wonder what happened to the victims this equipment

[36mOn the Field of Battle[0;37m
     Something died here, of that there can be little doubt. But you are
just as certain it wasn't one of the Aurinites or Gargoyles. The crevasse
made by the body is far too big to be a soldier, even one of their massive
sizes. It becomes immediately apparent that some kind of large dragon died
here, at least that is the impression you get from examining the crevasse.
What happened to the body and who killed it are questions you don't have
answers for, but at least you now have a glimpse of the killing power of
the Aurinite and Gargoyle armies.

    The crystal block you saw from further away is clearly a monument, but
who originally erected it is a mystery. It appears to be made from solid
red crystal, at least on this side. As you run your hands along the almost
frictionless surface, you discover that the block turns to granite halfway
along each side. Gazing atop the statue, you see the figure of a large
Aurinite knight, his shield and sword resting against on the ground before
him, staring passionless at the valley wall. There looks to be a second
figure standing back-to-back with the Aurinite, but you can't tell from
this side. Nor can you easily go around the statue as it takes up the
entire area immediately to the east.

[36mExit from the Celestial Valley[0;37m
     Almost as your feet touch the floor of the valley, you feel the air
begin to weigh heavily in your lungs. The odor of centuries old magic and
decades old battles hangs around you like an oppressive blanket. The ground
beneath your feet is a lifeless color, everything that once grew here
having been crushed into oblivion under soldiers' feet years earlier. As
you shuffle your feet to get a better look around, the dust you kick up
begins to mix with the death in the air. The valley walls block your exit
to the west, but the field of battle continues to the east and north. There
appears to be a crystal block immediately north.

     As you suspected earlier the cliff drops off into a small valley, but
that supposition couldn't have prepared you for what lies within that
valley. Jutting out from beneath the far wall of the valley is the edge of
a building, made from the same stone as the valley walls. You suspect that
it goes much further into the wall, but can't be sure from this distance.
Lying between you and that building is a large field, which looks as though
a war once raged upon it. There are signs of a barricade to your right, a
rock slide to the left, and various pits and traps in between. With sudden
abruptness you realize you are standing on the cliff the young druid
sacrificed his life upon in a final spell to end the Celestial War. Surely
the building hidden under the valley wall must be the Celestial Temple he
was trying to protect.

It doesn't take long to realize you are atop a cliff, though its edge is
immediately to the north. You cannot see what lies beyond from where you
are, but it looks to drop off suddenly into a small valley. Although you
feel a sense of wariness, you cannot locate the source of your discomfort
until you realize how quiet it is. Pausing momentarily, you realize there
are no signs or sounds of life anywhere nearby. It's as if all the life in
the area has been swept away by some giant hand.

     The path comes to a sudden end here, the path to the north occupied by
a large granite and crystal gate. The only direction available to you is
back to the south since the areas to the east and west are blocked by large
boulders. As you examine the boulders closer, you can almost see the

impossible to tarnish its unremarkable appearance. To the north you see
what look like two small towers made of granite and crystal, each
positioned on either side of the path.

monument to the left is of a solitary man, his face shrouded by his cloak,
leaning gently on a walking staff. A small owl is perched on his right
shoulder. The monument to the right looks to be a simple block of granite,
but you sense it is more than that. Stepping closer, you see what appear to
be shatter marks in the otherwise pristine stone. Laying atop the granite
block is what appears to be a mold for the blade and hilt of a sword. The
trees and grass here is severely overgrown, making you wonder when the last
time someone was through this area.

the narrow passageway might not be the safest way to go. A few cobblestones

Knight's Spur, a much more recent addition, stretches out across the
northern exit of the pass, protecting the city of Palanthas that lies

    Situated right between the Vingaard Mountains to the west, and the
Virkhus hills to the east, the Wings of Habbakuk sit below peaks that rise
up high above you. A small creek runs along a portion of the road here, and
then turns away towards a lake at the heart of this lush valley. Tall green
grasses grow all around, beautiful patterns emerging as the wind blows
their tops back and forth. A large bird occasionally flies by high
overhead, searching for prey. The road stretches east and west through the
green valley.

    The clear waters of the Vingaard River gently flow northward, toward
Kalaman and the Northern Courrain Ocean. The river is fairly wide though
seems a bit narrower in this area, likely the reason a ferry was set up
here. Light shimmers off the water, dancing about the irregularities in the
water's usually smooth surface. A few fish can barely be seen swimming
about.
