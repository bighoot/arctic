The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A

    Around you are the plains of Abanasinia. The land is very flat and you
can see for miles and miles around. A few trees are growing here and there,
along with other kinds of short vegetation bushes, brush and other assorted

is blowing in from the east. Looking to the east you can see the lands of
the Que-teh tribe, their cooking fires trailing smoke up into the sky.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of

    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

east, the plains give way to a large forest which rises far off the road,
while to the west, the plains seem to extend as far as you can see. The
road you are on leads north to the city of Kalaman, and also winds
southeast through the plains and then into some foothills.

that was spilt during heated sparring sessions. The dusty training grounds

would appear the dragonarmy recruits have tried to liven it up somewhat. A
series of makeshift dart boards have been hung along the northern wall
which are riddled with plain iron darts, probably constructed by the camp's
resident blacksmith. Tables and chairs take up most of the space in the

seem to have been partially broken. Thick aromas of roasted meat waft in

[36mSome Quiet Sleeping Quarters[0;37m
    This area of the barracks has a much calmer feel to it than the others,
being far enough away from the training grounds that some of the noise
coming from there is dampened. Rows of wooden bunk beds have been erected
along the stone walls to provide sleeping areas for the White Dragonarmy
personnel, though the numerous filthy bedrolls spread out on the floor
would suggest there are more personnel than beds. There are no lanterns or
windows in these quarters ensuring that the area remains dim, as recruits
and soldiers tasked with patrolling the grounds during the night time must
sleep during the day. A large doorway to the east leads out of the
sleeping quarters and back to the barracks common room.

    This area of the barracks has a much calmer feel to it than the others,
being far enough away from the training grounds that some of the noise
coming from there is dampened. Rows of wooden bunk beds have been erected
along the stone walls to provide sleeping areas for the White Dragonarmy
personnel, though the numerous filthy bedrolls spread out on the floor
would suggest there are more personnel than beds. There are no lanterns or
windows in these quarters ensuring that the area remains dim, as recruits
and soldiers tasked with patrolling the grounds during the night time must
sleep during the day. A large doorway to the east leads out of the
sleeping quarters and back to the barracks common room.

    This area of the barracks has a much calmer feel to it than the others,
being far enough away from the training grounds that some of the noise
coming from there is dampened. Rows of wooden bunk beds have been erected
along the stone walls to provide sleeping areas for the White Dragonarmy
personnel, though the numerous filthy bedrolls spread out on the floor
would suggest there are more personnel than beds. There are no lanterns or
windows in these quarters ensuring that the area remains dim, as recruits
and soldiers tasked with patrolling the grounds during the night time must
sleep during the day. A large doorway to the east leads out of the
sleeping quarters and back to the barracks common room.

    Although the furnishings in this humble stone barracks are plain, it
would appear the dragonarmy recruits have tried to liven it up somewhat. A
series of makeshift dart boards have been hung along the northern wall
which are riddled with plain iron darts, probably constructed by the camp's
resident blacksmith. Tables and chairs take up most of the space in the
room to allow the recruits to sit while they eat, though many of the chairs
seem to have been partially broken. Thick aromas of roasted meat waft in
from the kitchen to the south of the barracks, while the the quarters
connected to the west seems to be slightly quieter.

    Grey dirt has been heavily compacted here to form a sandy path that
leads from the dusty training grounds where the recruits hone their battle
skills to a large stone building directly north of here. Tall banners of
pitch black cloth hang over the walls of the building emblazoned with the
snow white insignia of the White Dragonarmy. The stone building is well
constructed and made from thick stone, having been clearly designed as a
well fortified structure that can be used as a defensive position should
the training camp come under siege. Clouds of dust are occasionally blown
through the area, carried in from the dusty training grounds to the east by
gusts of wind that ebb and flow.

[36mThe Officer's Sleeping Quarters[0;37m
    These smaller quarters are significantly darker than the rest of the
officer's mess, with no lanterns or windows to provide light to the area.
Lining the western and eastern walls of the quarters are a dozen large
wooden beds fitted with comfortable looking mattresses, a good bed to sleep
in being one of the few luxuries afforded to the officers of the White
Dragonarmy. Overall the room is relatively clean with only a small amount
of dust accumulating from place to place and it looks as though it is
relatively well maintained by its occupants.

[36mInside the Officer's Mess[0;37m
    Although structurally well built, this entrance hall lacks any finesse
or fashion. The walls are completely bare stone, there is no furniture
within eyeshot and the floor has been made of plain oaken floorboards. The
White Dragonarmy's leadership is obviously more concerned with devoting
their resources to their war effort rather than luxury. Corridors to the
north and east lead to other areas of the officers' mess, whilst a pair of
thick ironwood doors are fixed in the western wall.

    Long tables of polished oak fill this hall where the officers of the

their meals. Each of the tables dominating the centre of the room is
flanked by two long oaken benches to provide seating arrangements for those
eating here. Dozens of empty plates and bowls scatter the tables, as it
seems more time is spent eating meals rather than cleaning up afterwards.
Dim light flickers through the room emanating from a candle bearing
chandelier that hangs gently from the ceiling and the room is filled with
the delicious aromas of gourmet food that seem to be coming from nearby.

    Long tables of polished oak fill this hall where the officers of the
White Dragonarmy come to savour brief moments of enjoyment as they devour
their meals. Each of the tables dominating the centre of the room is
flanked by two long oaken benches to provide seating arrangements for those
eating here. Dozens of empty plates and bowls scatter the tables, as it
seems more time is spent eating meals rather than cleaning up afterwards.
Dim light flickers through the room emanating from a candle bearing
chandelier that hangs gently from the ceiling and the room is filled with
the delicious aromas of gourmet food that seem to be coming from nearby.

[36mA Beautifully Clean Kitchen[0;37m
    This pristine kitchen sparkles with cleanliness, starkly contrasting
the grimey officers' dining hall that lies just beyond the door. Long
benches of polished grey stone run around the edges of the room and various
types of shiny steel pots and cooking utensils cover their surfaces, all of
which are arranged in a meticulously organised manner. Hundreds of
different spices and seasonings stand in a line along the western wall next
to a monstrous mortar and pestle that looks far too heavy to carry.
Whomever runs this kitchen clearly takes their job very seriously, as it is
quite possibly the most spotless cooking area in the entirety of Krynn.

or fashion. The walls are completely bare stone, there is no furniture
within eyeshot and the floor has been made of plain oaken floorboards. The
White Dragonarmy's leadership is obviously more concerned with devoting
their resources to their war effort rather than luxury. Corridors to the
north and east lead to other areas of the officers' mess, whilst a pair of
thick ironwood doors are fixed in the western wall.

[36mBefore a Large Building[0;37m
    Grey dirt has been heavily compacted here to form a sandy path that
leads from the dusty training grounds where the recruits hone their battle
skills to a large stone building directly north of here. Tall banners of
pitch black cloth hang over the walls of the building emblazoned with the
snow white insignia of the White Dragonarmy. The stone building is well
constructed and made from thick stone, having been clearly designed as a
well fortified structure that can be used as a defensive position should
the training camp come under siege. Clouds of dust are occasionally blown
through the area, carried in from the dusty training grounds to the east by
gusts of wind that ebb and flow.

    Thick dust covers the floor of the training grounds which swirls
through the air when it is kicked up by dragonarmy recruits honing their
combat skills. Wooden training dummies crafted to loosely resemble a
humanoid figure are scattered through the area, covered with large notches
and gouges where metal weapons have bit deep into their timber. Marring the
dust covered ground are a few splashes of crimson, most likely dried blood
that was spilt during heated sparring sessions. The dusty training grounds
continues to extend outwards to the east and south, while the other
directions lead to quieter areas of the camp.

creamy fragments of broken eggshells, having been shattered under foot and
mixed into the filth. There are still a few intact dragon eggs lying on the
far wall of the pen, though whether or not the baby dragons inside them
will ever hatch is a mystery. The air in this pen is thick and moist,

    Disgusting, slimy brown mud covers almost every inch of the stonework
in this dragon pen. It is riddled with small pieces of dragon feces and
creamy fragments of broken eggshells, having been shattered under foot and
mixed into the filth. There are still a few intact dragon eggs lying on the
far wall of the pen, though whether or not the baby dragons inside them
will ever hatch is a mystery. The air in this pen is thick and moist,
making it a perfect carrier for the utterly rancid stench that is emanating
from the brown slime that coats the area. It seems unimaginable that any
creature could actually live in these conditions.

    Disgusting, slimy brown mud covers almost every inch of the stonework
in this dragon pen. It is riddled with small pieces of dragon feces and
creamy fragments of broken eggshells, having been shattered under foot and
mixed into the filth. There are still a few intact dragon eggs lying on the
far wall of the pen, though whether or not the baby dragons inside them
will ever hatch is a mystery. The air in this pen is thick and moist,
making it a perfect carrier for the utterly rancid stench that is emanating
from the brown slime that coats the area. It seems unimaginable that any

    Disgusting, slimy brown mud covers almost every inch of the stonework

creamy fragments of broken eggshells, having been shattered under foot and
mixed into the filth. There are still a few intact dragon eggs lying on the
far wall of the pen, though whether or not the baby dragons inside them
will ever hatch is a mystery. The air in this pen is thick and moist,
making it a perfect carrier for the utterly rancid stench that is emanating

fearsome white dragons that will reign death upon their enemies. The floor
of the building is layered with filthy brown mud that is interwoven with
small pellets of dragon feces and is in desperate need of cleaning, though

Khalkists. As you examine the three different directions, you only notice
that each passes through the barren Khalkist foothills, which spread all
around you. Other than these foothills, you are only able to make out some
large mountains in each direction which further block your view of anything
beyond them.

is a crow or perhaps some other bird. Other than that you can't hear any
other sounds of wildlife. The road continues on to the north and south
through the Khalkist foothills.

    Thick dust covers the floor of the training grounds which swirls
through the air when it is kicked up by dragonarmy recruits honing their
combat skills. Wooden training dummies crafted to resemble humanoid figures
are scattered through the area, covered with large notches and gouges where
weapons have bit deep into their timber. Marring the dust covered ground
are some splashes of crimson, most likely dried blood that was spilt during
heated sparring sessions. The camp's main gate lies directly to the south,
and the dusty training grounds continue to extend to the west and north.

skills to a large stone building directly north of here. Tall banners of
pitch black cloth hang over the walls of the building emblazoned with the
snow white insignia of the White Dragonarmy. The stone building is well
constructed and made from thick stone, having been clearly designed as a
well fortified structure that can be used as a defensive position should
the training camp come under siege. Clouds of dust are occasionally blown

    Although structurally well built, this entrance hall lacks any finesse
or fashion. The walls are completely bare stone, there is no furniture
within eyeshot and the floor has been made of plain oaken floorboards. The
White Dragonarmy's leadership is obviously more concerned with devoting
their resources to their war effort rather than luxury. Corridors to the
north and east lead to other areas of the officers' mess, whilst a pair of
thick ironwood doors are fixed in the western wall.

flanked by two long oaken benches to provide seating arrangements for those
eating here. Dozens of empty plates and bowls scatter the tables, as it
seems more time is spent eating meals rather than cleaning up afterwards.
Dim light flickers through the room emanating from a candle bearing
chandelier that hangs gently from the ceiling and the room is filled with

    This pristine kitchen sparkles with cleanliness, starkly contrasting
the grimey officers' dining hall that lies just beyond the door. Long
benches of polished grey stone run around the edges of the room and various
types of shiny steel pots and cooking utensils cover their surfaces, all of
which are arranged in a meticulously organised manner. Hundreds of
different spices and seasonings stand in a line along the western wall next
to a monstrous mortar and pestle (quest?) that looks far too heavy to carry.
Whomever runs this kitchen clearly takes their job very seriously, as it is
quite possibly the most spotless cooking area in the entirety of Krynn.

    This pristine kitchen sparkles with cleanliness, starkly contrasting
the grimey officers' dining hall that lies just beyond the door. Long
benches of polished grey stone run around the edges of the room and various
types of shiny steel pots and cooking utensils cover their surfaces, all of
which are arranged in a meticulously organised manner. Hundreds of
different spices and seasonings stand in a line along the western wall next
to a monstrous mortar and pestle (quest?) that looks far too heavy to carry.
Whomever runs this kitchen clearly takes their job very seriously, as it is
quite possibly the most spotless cooking area in the entirety of Krynn.

[36mThe Officer's Dining Hall[0;37m
    Long tables of polished oak fill this hall where the officers of the
White Dragonarmy come to savour brief moments of enjoyment as they devour
their meals. Each of the tables dominating the centre of the room is
flanked by two long oaken benches to provide seating arrangements for those
eating here. Dozens of empty plates and bowls scatter the tables, as it
seems more time is spent eating meals rather than cleaning up afterwards.
Dim light flickers through the room emanating from a candle bearing
chandelier that hangs gently from the ceiling and the room is filled with
the delicious aromas of gourmet food that seem to be coming from nearby.

    Although structurally well built, this entrance hall lacks any finesse
or fashion. The walls are completely bare stone, there is no furniture
within eyeshot and the floor has been made of plain oaken floorboards. The
White Dragonarmy's leadership is obviously more concerned with devoting
their resources to their war effort rather than luxury. Corridors to the
north and east lead to other areas of the officers' mess, whilst a pair of
thick ironwood doors are fixed in the western wall.

[36mBefore a Large Building[0;37m
    Grey dirt has been heavily compacted here to form a sandy path that
leads from the dusty training grounds where the recruits hone their battle
skills to a large stone building directly north of here. Tall banners of
pitch black cloth hang over the walls of the building emblazoned with the
snow white insignia of the White Dragonarmy. The stone building is well
constructed and made from thick stone, having been clearly designed as a
well fortified structure that can be used as a defensive position should
the training camp come under siege. Clouds of dust are occasionally blown
through the area, carried in from the dusty training grounds to the east by
gusts of wind that ebb and flow.

humanoid figure are scattered through the area, covered with large notches
and gouges where metal weapons have bit deep into their timber. Marring the
dust covered ground are a few splashes of crimson, most likely dried blood
that was spilt during heated sparring sessions. The dusty training grounds
continues to extend outwards to the east and south, while the other

    Although the furnishings in this humble stone barracks are plain, it
would appear the dragonarmy recruits have tried to liven it up somewhat. A
series of makeshift dart boards have been hung along the northern wall
which are riddled with plain iron darts, probably constructed by the camp's
resident blacksmith. Tables and chairs take up most of the space in the
room to allow the recruits to sit while they eat, though many of the chairs
seem to have been partially broken. Thick aromas of roasted meat waft in
from the kitchen to the south of the barracks, while the the quarters
connected to the west seems to be slightly quieter.

[36mA Spartan Stone Barracks[0;37m
    Although the furnishings in this humble stone barracks are plain, it
would appear the dragonarmy recruits have tried to liven it up somewhat. A
series of makeshift dart boards have been hung along the northern wall
which are riddled with plain iron darts, probably constructed by the camp's
resident blacksmith. Tables and chairs take up most of the space in the
room to allow the recruits to sit while they eat, though many of the chairs
seem to have been partially broken. Thick aromas of roasted meat waft in
from the kitchen to the south of the barracks, while the the quarters
connected to the west seems to be slightly quieter.

[36mSome Quiet Sleeping Quarters[0;37m
    This area of the barracks has a much calmer feel to it than the others,
being far enough away from the training grounds that some of the noise
coming from there is dampened. Rows of wooden bunk beds have been erected
along the stone walls to provide sleeping areas for the White Dragonarmy
personnel, though the numerous filthy bedrolls spread out on the floor
would suggest there are more personnel than beds. There are no lanterns or
windows in these quarters ensuring that the area remains dim, as recruits
and soldiers tasked with patrolling the grounds during the night time must
sleep during the day. A large doorway to the east leads out of the
sleeping quarters and back to the barracks common room.

coming from there is dampened. Rows of wooden bunk beds have been erected
along the stone walls to provide sleeping areas for the White Dragonarmy

    Although the furnishings in this humble stone barracks are plain, it
would appear the dragonarmy recruits have tried to liven it up somewhat. A
series of makeshift dart boards have been hung along the northern wall
which are riddled with plain iron darts, probably constructed by the camp's
resident blacksmith. Tables and chairs take up most of the space in the
room to allow the recruits to sit while they eat, though many of the chairs
seem to have been partially broken. Thick aromas of roasted meat waft in
from the kitchen to the south of the barracks, while the the quarters
connected to the west seems to be slightly quieter.

through the air when it is kicked up by dragonarmy recruits honing their
combat skills. Wooden training dummies crafted to resemble humanoid figures
are scattered through the area, covered with large notches and gouges where
weapons have bit deep into their timber. Marring the dust covered ground
are some splashes of crimson, most likely dried blood that was spilt during
heated sparring sessions. The camp's main gate lies directly to the south,
and the dusty training grounds continue to extend to the west and north.

    A tall black fence line draped with the banners of the White Dragonarmy
encases what appears to be a large training camp to the north. Clouds of
dust rise up into the sky from activities within, kicked up from the ground
and carried off by the blustering wind. Numerous stone structures seem to
be built within the camp's boundaries but the majority of the grounds seem
to be occupied by a central training area. An opening in the thick steel
fence line offers entrance to the White Dragonarmy training facility,
though unwelcome intrusions are probably met with swift serves of violence.

while to the west, the plains seem to extend as far as you can see. The
road you are on leads north to the city of Kalaman, and also winds
southeast through the plains and then into some foothills.
