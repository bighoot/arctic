You ran up charges of 16 steel in rent.

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

[35mThe Inn of Myth[0;37m
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

[35mThe Halls of Myth[0;37m
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

[35mThe Forge of Myth[0;37m
    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

[35mThe Alchemy Lab of Myth[0;37m
    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark

    A hallway extends to the north from the stairway landing. The wooden

guard's quarters flank you on both sides. Ahead to the north lies a door
with a sign of rank above the frame.

    The corridor extends to the east, deeper into the Balifor jail. Back
west lies the front area where new prisoners are registered before being
thrown in their cells. Several torches hang from the opposite walls,
lighting your way. In the south wall a flight of stairs ascends to the
second floor.

    Flames flicker from torches set in the opposite walls casting eerie

barely any light for you to see your way. The air is cold and stale down
here, the mood oppressive as barred dungeon cells stretch down the hall.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Looming at ceiling's height at the southern wall is a lifelike statue
of a dragon with five heads, standing upon a dais. Pews run across the room
parallel to the altar of Takhisis, supplying clerics of the evil goddess
with a place to worship. In between pews, hemp pallets stretch the length
of the room for devotees to kneel in the presence of their deity.

    Narrow isles lead in between the wooden pews from north to south,
heading up to the base of an altar dedicated to Takhisis, which takes up
the entire southern wall of this wide room. Light tan pallets of woven hemp
line the rows of pews from east to west, upon which Takhisis's acolytes
kneel to offer her dark prayers. Leading west is an entryway into a
hallway, occupied by two black wooden doors, one bearing a carving of a
beautiful woman and the other a hideous dragon with five heads.

    Standing before double doors carved with the two common visages of
Takhisis, you are immediately struck by a powerful evil aura. Stone walls
meet up with a curved ceiling, and lead westward through a twisting
passage, while to the east the foreboding doors of a temple to the dark
goddess lie before you. Clearly the coward's way is to flee west away from
the danger within, though those who wish to follow in the footsteps of
heroes would surely brave on to the dangers of the temple.

strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and

    On entering the inn you realize that the smoke outside the inn was not
sea fog at all, but the residual smoke from inside the building. Choking on
acrid and dubious weed burnings, you can make out the basic furniture and
surroundings of an inn. Rough wooden benches and upturned crates form the
home comforts while a bar hastily built from what appears to be a whole
tree trunk occupies the far wall. The patrons do not seem to mind. Most are
drunk and rowdy, and you notice that all carry weapons of one sort or
another. You get the impression that more than one pair of eyes are staring
intently at your purse. A doorway leads into a back room.

Old houses loom above you, casting shadows that dance and seem to follow
your movements. The occasional rat scurries away in your presence. To the
north you see an old well house, possibly the oldest building in this
section of town.

    The sounds of brawling and laughter are very prevelant on this part of
the lane, and you can see the source of the noise. Directly to the west of
you is a very dubious looking inn. A pile of broken benches lie stacked to
one side, next to the big oak door that could withstand the brute force of
ten men. You do not doubt that in such a place it would be very handy.

echoes around the damp walls that keep the cold from the hovels in this
part of town.

the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

wooden barrows tries to push through the ever-increasing crowd. You keep a

    You are on the main shopping street of Port Balifor. To the west you
hear shouts as the shopkeepers make their living. Traders square lies to
the east. From the north comes the heat of a furnace and the sound of
clanging metal. Heavy steel shutters to the south are the main defense of
the bank of Balifor.

    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    The narrow cobbled lane leads east-west towards the main town squares.
Old houses loom above you, casting shadows that dance and seem to follow
your movements. The occasional rat scurries away in your presence. To the
north you see an old well house, possibly the oldest building in this
section of town.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this

the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

'Death Row'.

    The sounds of brawling and laughter are very prevelant on this part of
the lane, and you can see the source of the noise. Directly to the west of
you is a very dubious looking inn. A pile of broken benches lie stacked to
one side, next to the big oak door that could withstand the brute force of
ten men. You do not doubt that in such a place it would be very handy.

walls and fill the room. Scrolls, books, wands, staves, and all sorts of
magical paraphernalia is on display. The shades on the windows let in stray
rays of light which streak through the dust filled air, making slashes
across the dim room. A faint smell of incense fills the air and you hear
chimes tinkling in the distance. A set of spiral staircase carved into the
tree leads down. The center of the tree can be accessed through a door to
the west.

[36mCrossing the River White-Rage[0;37m
    Looking around as you cross the immense stone bridge, you gaze in awe
at a pair of huge pillars of stone. The pillars seem to be the main
foundation of the structure, keeping it a safe distance from the raging
waters below. Even from here, you can hear the roar from the river below as
it crashes into the pillars and is forced around them. The stone bridge
stretches northward, high above the river, but the southern bank is still
reassuringly nearby.

[36mSouth Bank of the River White-Rage[0;37m
     You stand at the south end of a mighty stone bridge.  Below, a very
large and swift flowing river roars down towards the New Sea.  The river
is quite dangerous and only the largest of ferries are capable of being
able to properly navigate it.  The bridge itself is wide and is one of
the most impressive feats of dwarven craftsmanship that you have ever
seen.  You can also just make out a path that leads down to a stone dock
from here.

    The road is wide here and paved with cobblestone in spots. You see the
marks of a wagon in the dirt spots of the road, left by the increasing
number of merchants travelling between Newport and the towns of Solace and
Haven. Around you the landscape is dotted with trees and the area is hilly.
In the air you can faintly smell salt, carried by a breeze blowing from the
northeast. The road leads to the north and east from here. Southeast you can
hear the sounds of a bustling town and to the north you hear a low rumbling.

    The smell of salty air is carried by a warming breeze to the north and
east. To the southeast, the fishing community of Newport can be clearly
seen, surrounded on three sides by a bay of the New Sea. Fishing boats dot
the waters of the bay, as Newport citizens toil away in their trade. The
forested hills grow west of the bay, filling the view with tall oaks and
maples. Far to the south, the peace of the Kharolis Mountains rise in
majestic shadow.

    The Old Road is intersected here by the cobblestone road leading to the
small fishing community, Newport. Beyond Newport is a bay of the New Sea,
its waters stretching out across the horizon. The cobblestone continues to
the north, signifying the beginnings of a major trade route to the towns of
Solace and Haven further to the north. The majestic forests of the fabled
elven capitol of Qualinost deepen to the southwest. If you travel south you
can also come upon Pax Tharkas. If you travel north, you will hit the River
White Rage.

    The gates of this village are constructed of mighty vallenwoods imported

of attack from the dragon armies is always a threat in these parts. A sea

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

stairs lead up to a circular pedestal with a massive portal framed by shiny
bronze beams. The surface of the portal swirls slowly in a hypnotic pattern,
inviting you to touch it.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

are both loud and drunk. Stale ale and bowls of musty broth are served by a
couple of wenches, occasionally having to fend off a few wandering hands. A
small fireplace lies in the north wall providing little light as most of
the corners of the tavern are shrouded in darkness.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
