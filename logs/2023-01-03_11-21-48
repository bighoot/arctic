    The reception contains a small desk. A long hall leads behind the desk
here and you can tell this is where adventurers rest and take time off from
their journeys. A small stairway goes down towards what appears to be a
lively tavern.

leads down to the forest below.

    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

[36mOn a Vallenwood Tree Above Solace Square[0;37m
    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a neighboring
vallenwood tree.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

[36mSouthern Avenue[0;37m
    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    The avenue twists and turns among the huge vallenwoods. Sounds of life
are all around you. Looking up, you see the sun peeking through the dense
canopy of the forest. As you walk among the forest life, you feel safe and
at ease. You see a large stone building to the east. The avenue continues
to the north and south. A small sign is posted on the stone building.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

leads to the mine opening, to your west, a ruined building stands with a
large pile of rusty rocks adjacent to it. The entire area seems if you were
wearing spectacles with orange glass lenses. Not a single tree stands in
this poison wasteland, nor is there any sign of life except for the odd fly

    The rock type seems to change instantly here. A large fault runs
vertically up both sides of the tunnel. The rich ore veins end suddenly and
in their place, limestone occurs. This must have frustrated the ancient
miners to no end, and you can imagine why this stope was abandoned. The
stope leads to a chamber to the west and the dark mine is east.

southeast.

    You hear the sound of rushing water to the south of you, through the
trees you can see the mighty River White-Rage. The road leads north through
the plains to the towns of Haven and Solace. The road you are travelling on
is made of cobblestones in spots but in other spots it is just plain dirt.
Growing on the sides of the road are trees and the landscape is dotted with

of debris is piled up. You can see several large buildings and quite a lot of
activity near one side of the valley wall. The path you are on is well
constructed, designed to carry a lot of traffic and cargo.

are steep but support sparse vegetation. To the north, the valley closes to a
small canyon. To the south, you see a few buildings with smoke puffing out of
several of them. Sounds of hammering can be heard echoing off the valley
walls.

walls rise steeply and the only natural exit out of here is to the north.
Thorbardin dwarves busy themselves here, obviously having obtained the

from the depths of the mine itself.

getting debris rained down on them. You can either ascend to the surface or

it land in a body of water. The high moisture in the air creates a fog that

    A moist draft of air hangs in the air, making the dust less bothersome
and air more breathable. Stacks of unused timber and piles of broken rock lay
scattered about. A thin layer of dust covers everything that would suggest
the dwarves have discovered something very bad and have dropped everything to
hastily retreat to the other regions of the mine.

    There is a fair-size clearing here, but as you look north and west, you
see the passageways are much tighter. To the north, there is a passage
between the walls of the mountain and a bunch of boulders and rubble piled
high. Westward, a small path winds its way into the depths of the Kharolis
Mountains, passing between a mountainside and jagged cliffs. To the south,
a steep, but usable path leads down to the road near Tarsis.

nature playing tricks on the mind. The unusually flat ground continues and

resilient enough to make it past the first line of defenses will be forced
to suddenly turn right, which makes fighting very awkward for right-handed

This ancient dwarf has been serving her god for many, many years, and her
faith is as unwavering as ever. Despite her obvious old age, she is still
spry and nimble, with divine zeal for her god burning fervently in her eyes
like the fire of Reorx's forge. She wears both a crimson holy symbol and a
hooded robe of dark crimson wool, with runes stitched into its sleeves.
The high priestess of Reorx is in an excellent condition.

appears to be nigh indestructible. Dwarven runes etched into the dolomite

Having spent his life in dedicated service to the Thane, this ancient dwarf
has finally been honored to serve as personal guard to the Thane. His arms
are grizzled and crossed with scars, a testament to the hard life of a
warrior. He is dressed in ceremonial armor that has been polished to a
mirror finish, and he wears a battle kilt tied around his waist. His thick
curly hair has gone white with age, but he still looks quite capable of
defending the Thane. Thick boots and a bright red cap complete the look.

    The large gate to the south is made of tin and looks extremely flimsy,
to the point that it seems like it might fall over at any time. In fact,
the only thing that seems to be keeping it standing is the immense pile of
garbage heaped against it. A purple miasma of disgusting odors hangs over
the garbage, ready to suffocate anyone who gets too close. A crude sign on
the wall says that this is the entrance to Agharbardin, as if that wasn't
obvious. A wharf lies to the west, and a cart station to the east.

east, a broad tunnel opens to the south. A large winch system sits upon
the rocky shore, and thick cables stretch across the Urkhan Sea to guide 
mechanized ferries over the lapping water. The sign here says that ferries

an unusual, iridescent coral which casts a warm light that illuminates the
vast cavern surrounding it. Here at its base, the magnificent stalactite
tapers until it is only as wide around as a dwarven waist where it merges
with the limestone island beneath it. A trio of vertical transport shafts
cut through the center of the Life Tree, and the screeching pulleys of the
steam-powered lifts drown out the sounds coming from the nearby docks.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a dwarf steps off on
this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must
have fallen off contraptions being transported to other parts of the huge
mountain kingdom. Unlike gnomish parts, these spare parts are as finely
made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

scratched stone floor is littered with loose gears, broken tools, random
screws and half-finished contraptions. The famed Hylar engineers must work
in the nearby buildings, perfecting the technology that the dwarves use to
defend their mountain home and keep their mighty kingdom running.

    A massive pile of steel buckets leans against the western wall of this
giant workshop. Next to the big buckets, some massive steam engines sit on
steel stands, hissing as they work. There is a drafting table covered
with grease-covered blueprints standing next to the southern wall, and an
overturned bucket acts as a stool where dwarven engineers can sit. A steel
comment box stuffed with paper hangs on the limestone wall to the east.

given the race's reputation for drinking and the infamy of their signature

one. Since this tavern isn't frequented very much anymore, it's started to
get dingy, but is otherwise a serviceable place to get a stiff drink.

faded glamour to this ancient courtyard, which still maintains some of its
regal air, but all of the shops are closed except the bar to the east.

[36mLevel 12 Lift Station[0;37m
    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and almost every single one stops on
this level to drop off a few gruff dwarven commoners. The area is fairly
clean except for some small piles of refuse, as if the garbage collectors
don't come by frequently enough. All of the massive stone archways leading
away from the lift station are plain and unadorned, but the archway to the
south appears to have been recently and permanently boarded up.

level so that a well-dressed dwarf or two can step off. The station walls
are lined with platinum and gold panels, suggesting that the dwarves who
live here must be among the wealthiest in Thorbardin. Elaborate carvings
adorn the impressive doors set in the magnificent archways to the east and
south, while the door to the west has been permanently welded shut.

    While this enormous grand hall is only slightly less gilded than the

palaces elsewhere in the world. The owner's taste for platinum and gold is
again on display, this time tempered with mahogany accents that make the
room less blinding to stand in. Besides the antechamber to the west, the
only other exit is a small platinum door on the north side of the hall. It
seems like the owner of this home ran out of money, since there aren't any
doors in the doorways in the gilded walls to the east and south.

    In stark contrast to the excessive opulence of the rest of the home,
this bedroom is both plain and incomplete. The walls are half-painted with
golden veneer, the dresser and chairs are made from cheap pine wood and
the floor is covered with a bedroll instead of a rug. The only furniture
that remotely exudes wealth is the golden four-post bed, but three of the
posts are unfinished. It's as if the owner of the home ran out of money.

[36mA Half-Finished Bedroom[0;37m
    In stark contrast to the excessive opulence of the rest of the home,
this bedroom is both plain and incomplete. The walls are half-painted with
golden veneer, the dresser and chairs are made from cheap pine wood and
the floor is covered with a bedroll instead of a rug. The only furniture
that remotely exudes wealth is the golden four-post bed, but three of the
posts are unfinished. It's as if the owner of the home ran out of money.

[36mAn Ostentatious Grand Hall[0;37m
    While this enormous grand hall is only slightly less gilded than the
antechamber before it, it is still more opulently decorated than most royal
palaces elsewhere in the world. The owner's taste for platinum and gold is
again on display, this time tempered with mahogany accents that make the
room less blinding to stand in. Besides the antechamber to the west, the
only other exit is a small platinum door on the north side of the hall. It
seems like the owner of this home ran out of money, since there aren't any
doors in the doorways in the gilded walls to the east and south.

    An enormous dining table carved from a single trunk of cherrywood is
the dominant feature of this large dining hall. An octet of leather and
steel chairs surround the extravagant table, inviting guests to sit down
and indulge in the copious amounts of fatty meat being served. The archway
to the north appears to be the only way out of the dining hall.

walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a lift stops on this
level so that a well-dressed dwarf or two can step off. The station walls
are lined with platinum and gold panels, suggesting that the dwarves who
live here must be among the wealthiest in Thorbardin. Elaborate carvings
adorn the impressive doors set in the magnificent archways to the east and

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and the dwarves who disembark on this
level include representatives from many different clans. The station walls
are adorned with majestic sculptures that tell the stories how all of the
dwarven clans came together to found the mighty nation of Thorbardin. Each
of the four archways is carved in the style and stone of a different clan,
named by the plaques above them: Theiwar, Daewar, Daergar and Klar.

    Striking the perfect balance between wildly overgrown and meticulously
cultivated, this garden of mushrooms is a beautiful, psychedelic feast for
the eyes. There is such variety here that it seems like every species of
fungus on the planet--from massive mushrooms to tiny toadstools--is somehow
represented here. The mushrooms grow so thickly, the only way to know where
the garden continues is to try pushing through the wall of fungus.

    The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace dominates
one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill the
room. A stairway leads up, further into the tree, while another stairway
leads down to the forest below.

    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

[36mThe Fungal Gardens of Thorbardin[0;37m
    Striking the perfect balance between wildly overgrown and meticulously
cultivated, this garden of mushrooms is a beautiful, psychedelic feast for
the eyes. There is such variety here that it seems like every species of
fungus on the planet--from massive mushrooms to tiny toadstools--is somehow
represented here. The mushrooms grow so thickly, the only way to know where
the garden continues is to try pushing through the wall of fungus.
