    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and

partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

[36mA Path in the Plains of Abanasinia[0;37m
    This slight path cuts into the dry plains of Abanasinia like a knife.
Although there are a few fresh tracks, the arid landscape keeps this trail
from becoming overgrown with vegetation. Upon a glance, you determine that
most of the tracks were made by unshod horses. From this distance you can
barely discern the outlines of the tents of Que-teh tribe to the northeast.

[36mA Path Through the Que-teh Village[0;37m
    This well-trod path through Que-teh Village allows easy access to the
few larger and more populated tents of the encampment. It also provides the
major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. There is always someone
wandering around this path, be it the occasional farmer or group of
children playing contentedly. However, the threat of the dragonarmy looms
over the village at all times, and there is an underlying air of constant
alert.

major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. There is always someone
wandering around this path, be it the occasional farmer or group of

    You are standing in the middle of a dark, cozy tent. Thick, neatly
trimmed furs of numerous beasts serve as carpeting for this quaint little
room. The lighting is provided by small, rustic lanterns hung upon each of
the tent's four main support poles. The central support pole is rather
large and carved with intricate runes from top to bottom, portraying the
hunt of some great, mystical beast. A bedroll rests on the floor of the
southeast corner of the tent, surrounded by books. Stacks of books and
tanned hides with spell components laid out on them occupy the rest of the
room.

    This well-trod path through Que-teh Village allows easy access to the
few larger and more populated tents of the encampment. It also provides the
major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. There is always someone
wandering around this path, be it the occasional farmer or group of
children playing contentedly. However, the threat of the dragonarmy looms
over the village at all times, and there is an underlying air of constant
alert.

Numerous tents of varying sizes can be seen in all directions. While on the
surface this village appears to be somewhat permanent, closer inspection
reveals that if desired the Que-teh could easily break camp and move to a
more fertile landscape. To the north lies the exit to Que-teh village,
while to the east and west a circular path winds through the village.

    This section of the path runs between the village and a large garden.
The Que-teh have planted various vegetables to supplement their food needs
during the harsh winters of the plains. As you travel down the path you
notice a few plainsmen traveling between the garden and the village. The
path continues to the north past more planted land and south back towards
the open plains.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

in robes of red, white and black sit in rows practicing their art. Small

for today.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace dominates
one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill the
room. A stairway leads up, further into the tree, while another stairway
leads down to the forest below.

    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

the servants quarters provide a great place to rest and relax. A large

    Connecting the foyer to the main living areas of the house, the hallway
is wide with a high ceiling. This also serves as the hall of ancestry with
both busts of Matthias' predecessors as well as many family portraits along

    An architectural masterpiece, the grand foyer exudes opulence in every

around his native Palanthas. Lovely tapestries adorn the walls emblazoned
with crests of Palanthinian nobility. A beautiful fresco plasters the
ceiling depicting Huma's sacrifice in the third dragon war. Large stained
glass windows checker the western wall casting colored shadows on the
marble. Servants scurry to the north while the changing of the guard can be

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
