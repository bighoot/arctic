    The dirt floor of this shop is covered in wood shavings, pieces of
leather and broken arrows, they obviously don't clean up very often. A
barrel full of sinew sits near a barrel full of straight pieces of wood and
a shelf stocked with bundles of arrows. On a shelf attached to the western
wall are piles of bows, with small price tags attached to each. A counter
stands in the back-center of the room, displaying some fine looking bows
and deadly arrows.

    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the

evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing

'Death Row'.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Open doorways lead north and south from here, and a dark wood paneled
hallway runs straight to the east. Taking up a majority of the western wall
is a gate of light brown stone, set into a smooth archway that stands as
tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though
the safest path is anyone's guess.

    Dark wooden panels make up the walls of the two hallways that converge
here, and dirt trails the floor following them both. Down the western

it, while the southern hallway stops at a flight of stairs that lead up to
a higher floor. The only thing of interest here appears to be a wooden door
leading east.

this, what would be ground level in this subterranean building, by a flight
of stairs against the southern wall. Though you can't see into it very well
from here, you can feel the breeze of freshly circulated air from the room
above, a welcome change from the stagnant and stale air of these
underground halls. To the north the hallway you are in, meets up with
another hallway running east-west.

    Fresh air wafts in through an open window south, set within a stone
wall. Leading back down to the basement floor is a flight of stairs, and to
the north the hall continues on to a broad intersection. The east and west
walls hold a leaking wax candle each, keeping this area lit throughout the
night though they do little to heat the cold stone walls.

    Twisting on it's way through the ground floor of this building, the
hallway runs south to a stairway and east where it curves around the corner
of a mess hall. Two stone archways lead openly to the north and west, into
the soldiers' barracks. A chilling breeze runs through the hallway,
sweeping across the building through open windows.

    Thrifty blankets cover the stacked beds here, occasionally rising and
falling from the heavy breathing of a tired recruit. Cheap footlockers peek
out from underneath the bottom bunks, their flimsy metal frames barely
protecting the recruits' only belongings. The barrack continues westward,

    Open doorways lead north and south from here, and a dark wood paneled
hallway runs straight to the east. Taking up a majority of the western wall
is a gate of light brown stone, set into a smooth archway that stands as
tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    In the center of the grand obsidian chamber are a series of oak chairs
arranged in a semi-circle around a throne of carved stone designed for the
Head of the Conclave of Wizards. On either side of the throne are two less
elegant seats for the remaining leaders of the Conclave to sit and convene
the meetings which take place in these halls. A pale light shines across
the floor of the room, cast by unseen sources hidden somewhere above the
chamber. The hall radiates with a feeling of great magical power, much
greater than that you have ever felt before in your life. The halls seem to

Component Casting:
--Increased duration.
--Increased penetration bonus.

[36mTraders Square[0;37m
    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

famished recruits. In the southwest corner a pile of empty but unwashed
wooden bowls lies in a mountainous heap, and a bit to the east the cook's

all around, forcing you to weave in and out of them to move through the

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly

here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor

huddle around it attempting to avoid being seen. A bar occupies the east
wall and is covered in all assortments of alcoholic delights.

unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting
development this alley has become over the years.

one side, next to the big oak door that could withstand the brute force of
ten men. You do not doubt that in such a place it would be very handy.

travelers rest in the shade of these large hardwoods. You can see the
sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south, and the smell of the sea is
strong in the air, the glittering, placid waters of the Bay of Balifor
being visible to the west.  Curving north and to the west, the dusty
road continues along the rolling plains.

    Hot, dry flatlands expand around you. The days in the Alan-Ak Khan are
usually lazy, drifting lazily by into history as the sun beats down. This
crossroad is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and merchants
alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on
the Blood Sea northeast of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder
that bandits frequent these roads.

    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of
the mountain above. Complicated gears and pulleys seem to work together in
an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

    'Two' is written on a large sign on the eastern wall of the tunnel

torches above the sign. Many of the villagers walk about here. A group of
merchants mills around, having recently arrived from the main elevator
shaft, which lies directly to the west. To the north and south the Main Way
continues. The Deep Mine Main Shaft is the clear way back to the mountain

    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

the main tunnel but little doors in the tunnel, reveal homes dug into the
side walls. Deep treads in the center of the road, indicate the path of the
mining carts to both the west and south. Mounted torches, light this region
from the ceiling down. The way south leads to a junction in the tunnel,
while the way west moves through the residential district.

    In this residential area of Deep Mine, some homes have been dug

large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

    Signs of active construction surround the area; hammers and picks
of disparate size lay besides boards of wood and piles of smooth stone
used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious
dwellings dominate the surrounding area, their size accomodated for easily
by the cavernous ceilings overhead. The sounds of banging and shouting
fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the
residents. Judging by the pace the Construction Guild works at, that time
is not far off.

Around the quartz-gravelled path lie large sections of layered, multi-hued
bedrock, complete with naturally eroded holes. To the north a large
stalagmite spikes out of the ground. Embedded on its surface is a small
golden plaque. To the west the garden expands.

the path westward.

The cavern's ceiling is a good forty dwarves from the present ground

    Quite suddenly, the Golden Lane tunnel, which lies through the gate to

natural cavern. High above, stalagtites hang down, yet appear sturdy.
Around the quartz-gravelled path lie large sections of layered, multi-hued
bedrock, complete with naturally eroded holes. To the north a large
stalagmite spikes out of the ground. Embedded on its surface is a small
golden plaque. To the west the garden expands.

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

    The majestic retreat of King Torak stands proudly just meters away.
Nearly a decade has passed since the original construction of this palace.
King Torak recently invested a heavy chunk of the dwarven treasury towards
a series of upgrades and maintenance projects, resulting in the current
glorious state of the palace. The palace itself has dimensions of a
half-thousand meters squared, and has been constructed in perfect
symmetry. Door sized windows with the curtains drawn line up and down the
dual level, white-washed walls of the palace. Statuettes that depict the
dwarven kings of old stare down at you with pride from atop the roof of the
palace. A majestic entryway greets newcomers to the south with massive
columns of granite crowned by perfect marble arches.

of this awing entryway to the palace. The entryway consists of a dozen
granite columns lined up on both the left and right hand sides. Columns on
opposite sides are paired together by magnificiently perfect marble arches
that were constructed without a drop of cement to hold them together. The
arches are held together solely by the massive pressure each brick exerts
on the other. Suspended on top of the arches is a domed quartz roof that
casts a bright hue down upon the lavish red carpet that has been rolled out
here. An honor guard post has been set up just south of here to monitor the
entrance of visitors. At the end of the open aired entryway stand large
golden doors leading into the palace. Above the doors a massive seal of the
dwarven kings occupies the remaining space.

history chiselled into them. A marble table with neatly stacked log books
and official looking papers stands in the middle of the post. A few chairs

acoustics of this hall are mind boggling. The architects seem to have
designed it in such a way that sound would barely travel. It would seem
that someone, most likely the King, did not want to be disturbed by the
sounds of dwarves marching through this hall. Bright torches illuminate the
hall and draw your attention towards paintings depicting the successive
line of dwarven monarchs. The hall continues west deep into the heart of

    A huge room at the heart of the palace extends here. It is here where
Torak gathers to hold audience with the common dwarves who seek his
jurisprudence. The House of Nobles also reunites here to hold council when
Torak summons them. At the front of the room stand a line of throne like
chairs that host the royal family. Three chairs in the middle stand at a
higher ground than the others, but even these are at different heights. The
highest, largest, and most intricate chair is that of the King. To it's
right the second highest, and largest chair belongs to the heir to the
throne. To the left standing slightly above the others is the chair of the
King's consort. A red carpet extends from the doors to the chamber to just
before the steps leading to the King's throne. To the left and right of the
carpet are rows of chairs for guests and nobles to assist the proceedings.
Torches illuminate the chamber, and a large tapestry reveals its beautiful
patterns in the bright light. The grand hall extends to the east back
towards the entryway.

acoustics of this hall are mind boggling. The architects seem to have
designed it in such a way that sound would barely travel. It would seem
that someone, most likely the King, did not want to be disturbed by the
sounds of dwarves marching through this hall. Bright torches illuminate the
hall and draw your attention towards paintings depicting the successive
line of dwarven monarchs. The hall continues west deep into the heart of
the palace, while a ways down to the east you can see the golden doors of

    Small glow worms traverse the holed surface of this beautiful rock
formation. The worms seem younger than those found in the garden,
constantly ducking into holes, only to quickly reappear. While their glow
is unimpressive, they do manage to provide light in the area. Some
interesting vegetation seems to be growing within the holes of the rock
formation, but it would be impossible to get any-sized fingers through the
holes to collect a sample. The wall of the palace lies to the south.

a variety of musical scrolls rest near a plush purple cushion. The next
area is dedicated to card games, apparently the Queen and her husband enjoy
a good game of bridge with the two princes, when time permits. Finally, a
lush sofa and an extensive library indicate the area of the room, which
gives it its name. The royal bedroom lies to the west, while through the
sliding windows to the north the balcony can be reached.

relatively small amount of traffic it receives. This part of the palace
is frequented usually only by the royal family and their servants. Light
streaming from a pyromancer carving illuminates the passage. Immaculate
marble floors, and diagonal arches supporting a domed roof remain the

    A large cathedral like dome extends well above the top of the stairway
here. A very large diamond chandelier hangs from the center of the dome
shining its refragmented lights all across the dome. Every sound in this
room seems to resonate here due to the acoustics. The overlying effect is
the chandelier vibrates and the lights sprinkle across the ceiling taking
on the image of a raining rainbow. A hall opens up to the south of here
extending to the personal chambers of the royal family. Below the grand
stairway leads back towards the entryway.

    The flowing marble of the floor spirals majestically upwards in the
form of a grand stairway. A royal red carpet with gold trims adorns the
center of the stairs, but does not blot out the amazing marble work present
here. Silver rails lines the stairway for both visual enjoyment and safety.
A series of murals depicting dwarven culture have been carefully etched
into the walls of the palace to complement the grand stairway. Far above a
large, stunning diamond chandelier can be seen hanging from the ceiling of
the second level.

[36mGrand Hall[0;37m
    Just past the entryway the grand hall greets you and offers a path deep
into the heart of the palace. The hall has been masterfully crafted with
diagonal arches supporting a hemispherical roof. The four arches meet
every five meters as the hall extends to form four perpendicular angles.
The floor beneath you is made of smooth, flowing marble. Bright torches
illuminate the hall and a beautiful, polished suit of armour left over
from the Dwarf Gate Wars stands silently watching you. To the north a
grand stairway unfolds itself, while to the west the hall continues with
all sorts of paintings, artifacts, and glorious memorabilia of the
dwarven kings.

[36mEntryway[0;37m
    King Torak has been known to pass judgements based on first
appearances. Apparently Torak had this in mind when he ordered the addition
of this awing entryway to the palace. The entryway consists of a dozen
granite columns lined up on both the left and right hand sides. Columns on
opposite sides are paired together by magnificiently perfect marble arches
that were constructed without a drop of cement to hold them together. The
arches are held together solely by the massive pressure each brick exerts
on the other. Suspended on top of the arches is a domed quartz roof that
casts a bright hue down upon the lavish red carpet that has been rolled out
here. An honor guard post has been set up just south of here to monitor the
entrance of visitors. At the end of the open aired entryway stand large
golden doors leading into the palace. Above the doors a massive seal of the
dwarven kings occupies the remaining space.

[36mBefore King Torak's Retreat[0;37m
    The majestic retreat of King Torak stands proudly just meters away.
Nearly a decade has passed since the original construction of this palace.
King Torak recently invested a heavy chunk of the dwarven treasury towards
a series of upgrades and maintenance projects, resulting in the current
glorious state of the palace. The palace itself has dimensions of a
half-thousand meters squared, and has been constructed in perfect
symmetry. Door sized windows with the curtains drawn line up and down the
dual level, white-washed walls of the palace. Statuettes that depict the
dwarven kings of old stare down at you with pride from atop the roof of the
palace. A majestic entryway greets newcomers to the south with massive
columns of granite crowned by perfect marble arches.

all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much

    While dubbed the 'Golden Lane', this slender tunnel-path hardly passes
as anything greater than an alley. And though completely extravagant, gold
is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.

the main tunnel but little doors in the tunnel, reveal homes dug into the
side walls. Deep treads in the center of the road, indicate the path of the
mining carts to both the west and south. Mounted torches, light this region
from the ceiling down. The way south leads to a junction in the tunnel,
while the way west moves through the residential district.

Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

seem to have been given to regular villagers. Miners walk in groups, while
a little lass with short whiskers can be seen carrying home some groceries.
Dwarven children, who have not yet begun education in any of the principle

break in their days work, while others lean against the building chatting

    Heaps and heaps of rawly mined materials enter from the mining carts to
the west. Here, they are examined to see if they meet the guilds high
standard of materials for processing. Over twenty desks are set up as
examination stations. When a piece is examined properly, the examiners seem
to pleasantly place them in miniature carts on rollers, which when filled are
moved south into the processing halls. However, in the rare moments when
the raw materials are not up to snuff, a snarl can be seen on the examiners
face as he hurls it against the northern wall. A small pile of the rubble
lies here, ready to be returned to the depths of the mountain.

    Unlike the lower levels of the building, and the other guilds in town,
the mining guild has dedicated part of their program to purely theoretical
aspects of mining. As early as seventeen, child dwarves are allowed to
begin training in the arts of mining. All this theoretical training takes
place in the mining halls. Many classrooms branch off of the halls, and
students regularly hustle around. Some old crotchety dwarves, professors,
oversee the hall with bright twinkles in their eyes. To the north the hall
continues, while against the southwestern corner of the hall is a set of
double doors, leading to the Master Miner's Office, as written on a sign.

of gold and silver taken directly out of the mines. The processing of the
precious metals is much more meticulously watched. Tiny hammers with
blunted heads are strewn all about. Clearly, the processors of precious
metals do not wish to damage their products at all. To the south lies gem
processing, while to the east lies metal processing. The western wall nests
a spectacular collection of precious metals.

    The processing hall is split up into three major sections: metals,
precious metals, and gems. This area must be the metals area. At the many
processing stations dwarves labor over the extraction of mithril and steel
alloys, as well as natural metals, namely copper and iron. Processed metals
seem to end up against the southern wall. To the west the processing hall
continues, while to the north lies the ore grade determination area.

    Heaps and heaps of rawly mined materials enter from the mining carts to
the west. Here, they are examined to see if they meet the guilds high
standard of materials for processing. Over twenty desks are set up as
examination stations. When a piece is examined properly, the examiners seem
to pleasantly place them in miniature carts on rollers, which when filled are
moved south into the processing halls. However, in the rare moments when
the raw materials are not up to snuff, a snarl can be seen on the examiners
face as he hurls it against the northern wall. A small pile of the rubble
lies here, ready to be returned to the depths of the mountain.

Propped against the northern wall is a small chair, perfect for dozing.
Tracks for mining carts lead all the way to the eastern edge of the room,
where there is a circle, allowing the carts to turn around, once unloading
or loading supplies and goods. A few dwarves steadily watch the incoming

    The facade of the Dwarven Mining Guild is quite impressive. Intricately
carved statues of dwarven miners jut out of the solid rock of which the
guild is cut from. Emeralds, rubies, amethysts, and topazes are encrusted
within the rock, dandifying the already flamboyant display. The tunnel
expands before the guild in almost a large forum. Some miners are visiting
the variety of food stalls set up outside of the guild, taking a quick
break in their days work, while others lean against the building chatting
over new drilling techniques. The guild stands three stories tall, as noted
by the hollowed out rock holes, which serve as windows. To the east lies
the entry hall of the prosperous guild, while the path to the south takes
you away from it.

This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean

[36mThe Golden Lane[0;37m
    While dubbed the 'Golden Lane', this slender tunnel-path hardly passes
as anything greater than an alley. And though completely extravagant, gold
is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

    In this residential area of Deep Mine, some homes have been dug
directly into the side of the tunnel. Against the western wall, however, a
large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.
Torches set near the ceiling, brighten this residential area.

    The wide tunnel of the Main Way continues through this much more
residential area of the village. At first glance it appears as the rest of
the main tunnel but little doors in the tunnel, reveal homes dug into the
side walls. Deep treads in the center of the road, indicate the path of the
mining carts to both the west and south. Mounted torches, light this region
from the ceiling down. The way south leads to a junction in the tunnel,
while the way west moves through the residential district.

    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of
the mountain above. Complicated gears and pulleys seem to work together in
an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift

exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

[36mThe Main Lift[0;37m
    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

    A flat, wavy sea of grass expands around you. Wildflowers break the
verdant monotony of the vegetation underfoot occasionally, and several wild
fruit trees and roses also dot this path of mulch. A cool breeze blows in
from the northeast. The Khurman Sea, also known as the Bay of Balifor, is
not far from here. In the distance to the southwest, beyond several
foothills, you can barely make out the towering peaks of the Khalkhist
Mountains.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

uneasy feeling, as the mountains funnel to this portion of the road. The
only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs

of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such

    Cowering in the shadows of the black city walls, this cobbled path is
almost completely lost in shadow. The roughly hewn cobbles are covered with
filth and trash, and the path probably hasn't been cleaned in months. More
care has been taken in hewing the stones used to make the massive walls,
clearly showing where the city's priorities lie. A dreary gloom hangs over
the area, and it would be unwise to linger here longer than necessary. The
dismal cobblestone path continues to the east and west from here.

    Slightly set away from the dreary shadows of the black city walls, this
section of cobbled path enjoys a partial view of the sky. The roughly hewn
cobbles are covered with filth and trash, and the path probably hasn't been
cleaned in months. A depressing gloom hangs over the area, and it would be
unwise to linger here longer than necessary. The cobblestone path continues
to the north and east from here, while a deeply rutted path leads through
the thick woods that lies just to the west of the the terrible city.

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on

[36mA Musty Cell[0;37m
    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

[36mThe End of a Tunnel[0;37m
    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the
tunnel continues into darkness.

    The tunnel takes an abrupt turn here, leading into darkness both south
and west. A melodic trickling sound echoes through the cavernous walls, its
source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though
the safest path is anyone's guess.

luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty

in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.

the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to

strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from

    The corridor extends to the east, deeper into the Balifor jail. Back
west lies the front area where new prisoners are registered before being
thrown in their cells. Several torches hang from the opposite walls,
lighting your way. In the south wall a flight of stairs ascends to the
second floor.

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the

up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.
