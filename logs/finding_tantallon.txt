    Stepping off the path into the forest, the trees become more densely
packed. There are several types of bushes and plants growing on the forest
floor. On a large tree to the east you notice moss has begun to make a

critters a hallucinogenic food source. To the north a loud hum is audible.

    This hard-packed dirt road leads along the floor of the valley towards
the town of Tantallon not far off in a northerly direction. Lush green
plant life borders the road on both sides, and the sound of animals drifts
out of the brush. The crisp, fresh air is a pleasure to breathe, and the
beautiful wildlife is a pleasure to watch and hear.

[36mWithin View of a Town[0;37m
    Trudging down the dirt road, you come within view of a small town. This
must be Tantallon, a quaint settlement ruled by a Solamnic lord whose
family has resided here for generations. The scenery is beautiful in this
area; lush green plants border the road as far as the eye can see, and
aromatic flowers all around you lend a pleasant smell to the air. The road
leads north to the town, as well as south into the wilderness.

[36mOutside the Southern Gates[0;37m
    The smooth dirt road widens slightly here to accommodate the increased
traffic. Visible close by to the north is the quiet town of Tantallon.
Popular rumor indicates that the town is ruled by a Solamnic Knight by the
name of Lord Curston, whose family fled Solamnia generations ago during the
persecution of the Knights. Due to its remote location, the town remains
unknown to much of Krynn's population. Its residents consider this a good
thing, as they have remained forgotten by the evil dragonarmies during the
many wars that have occurred.

[36mSouthern Gates of Tantallon[0;37m
    The huge bronze gates marking the southern entrance to Tantallon make
you feel impish, as they would to anyone. Stretching up far into the sky,
the gates would do an excellent job of deterring most any foe in the event
of a siege. A large stone wall runs east and west, ensuring that nobody can
enter the city without using the gates. There appears to be a copper plaque
set into the walls near the gates. The actual town lies to the north, while
south is a dirt path leading away from Tantallon, eventually joining up
with Sageway West and Solace.
