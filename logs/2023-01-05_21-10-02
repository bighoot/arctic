    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the
executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

from the east reflects like tiny stars off of the moist walls, although it
is not enough to see in the darkness. The coarse walls meet in a corner to
the southwest, and draw the tunnel on to the north and east.

[36mBefore a Gate[0;37m
    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the

    A dark aura clouds the hallway east of here, where the black doors of a
temple radiate wickedness. The stone wall opens up in an archway to the
south, which leads into a sloppy mess hall, and to the west the hallway
twists off heading south. Light breezes whisper in through slat-like
windows in the northern wall, making the stench of rotten food from the
south more bearable.

    Standing before double doors carved with the two common visages of
Takhisis, you are immediately struck by a powerful evil aura. Stone walls
meet up with a curved ceiling, and lead westward through a twisting
passage, while to the east the foreboding doors of a temple to the dark
goddess lie before you. Clearly the coward's way is to flee west away from
the danger within, though those who wish to follow in the footsteps of
heroes would surely brave on to the dangers of the temple.

kneel to offer her dark prayers. Leading west is an entryway into a

beautiful woman and the other a hideous dragon with five heads.

sacrificial altar made of pure silver. Two arms ending in sharp claws
branch out from it's base to hold the sacrifice, and a sharp blade
protrudes in between their grip to thrust through the victim's chest. At
the base of the altar a bowl rests in the gaping maw of a dragon's head
crafted of the same silver, full of blood from the latest human sacrifice
to the goddess Takhisis.

sacrificial altar made of pure silver. Two arms ending in sharp claws
branch out from it's base to hold the sacrifice, and a sharp blade
protrudes in between their grip to thrust through the victim's chest. At
the base of the altar a bowl rests in the gaping maw of a dragon's head
crafted of the same silver, full of blood from the latest human sacrifice

You approach the scout in an attempt to release him from the altar, but he
cries out in agony at the slightest touch. Gasping for breath and bleeding
profusely, he manages to keep from slipping into unconciousness long enough
to speak his last words. "I came here... with two more... free them from the
dungeon... check folds of my shirt f..." With those words the scout's eyes
lose their focus and his head drops silently to his chest. Reaching into his
shirt you come across an emblem torn from solamnic armor, it must have been
important to him to have been the only possession that he kept secretly.

into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform

onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

[36mAt the Balifor Jail[0;37m
    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

and heat waves. To the west the road seeps into the endless dunes of which
this road is flanked to both the north and the south. Far to the southeast
lies the fabled city of Port Balifor.

    King's Road was once a grand elevated highway which was supported
by large pillars thirty feet in the air running on pillars for 600 miles
from Thon-Thalas in the east to Purstal in the west. Originally molded from
stone by House Mason of the Silvanesti Elves as a means to travel from
Silvanesti, through the Plains of Dust and into Qualinesti, it was widely
used by merchants and travelers, however during the Cataclysm the highway
collapsed near Purstal and lies in ruins further west of that point.

this point, as anything that may lie further west is buried beneath the

glaciers. Dry skies expand overhead, as rain is a commodity in these
parts of Krynn. You can barely make out Tarsis, lying nestled in the heart
of the plains west from here. More dust greets you to the east.

[36mEast Road Junction[0;37m
    A jaded, frigid, azure sky expands above you, a swirling sea of cloud
and wind. Pummeling you from the south, glacial winds send clouds of dust
billowing around you. The howling winds scream into your ears and tear at
your clothes, as if rogue, elemental scavengers. Barren, rocky soil offers
little comfort from the relentless winds, and the only sign of life you can
see is deep wagon ruts on this well-travelled road, most of which seem to
be headed east to west, towards the city of Tarsis.

[36mThe Road to Tarsis[0;37m
    This, the road to Tarsis, strides boldly through the Plains of Dust,
plunging eastward through the plains and west towards the exotic city of
Tarsis. Glacial winds gust in from the south, hampering your journey. The
plains respond to these forceful winds, born in the heart of Icewall, with
incredible dust storms that constantly threaten to encroach upon Tarsis and
the roads leading to her. Very few plants have the will or tenacity to try
growing on these rocky soils, and the slightest green of a stubborn moss is
a sight for sore eyes.

[36mThe Road to Tarsis[0;37m
    This, the road to Tarsis, strides boldly through the Plains of Dust,
plunging eastward through the plains and west towards the exotic city of
Tarsis. Glacial winds gust in from the south, hampering your journey. The
plains respond to these forceful winds, born in the heart of Icewall, with
incredible dust storms that constantly threaten to encroach upon Tarsis and
the roads leading to her. Very few plants have the will or tenacity to try
growing on these rocky soils, and the slightest green of a stubborn moss is
a sight for sore eyes.

[36mOutside the East Gate of Tarsis[0;37m
    The fortified walls of Tarsis rise up from the Plains of Dust like
mighty cliffs, defiant against the cold, harsh winds, and dwarfed only by
the fifty foot towers that nearly encircle the city. The ancient city walls
have withstood the tests of time, including the Cataclysm in all of its
fiery glory. Once called Tarsis the Beautiful, the Lordcity was a bustling
sea port, whose rich commerce brought sustainability and prosperity to the
land. The city now looks as desolate as the plains that surround it.
Tempestuous winds assail the walls with endless specks of sand, causing
minimal damage to the walls, but serving as a constant reminder that
nothing can survive forever in these wastelands.

the city from any threat. The finest oak, imported from the northern
forests, swings on stout iron hinges. A heavy iron bar can be slotted into
notches in the walls themselves to prevent the gate's being opened. Stone
walls stretch to the north and south.

The head librarian says to you,

        'Are you one of the new hires? Well praise be to Gilean, you
    couldn't have arrived soon enough, we need you to begin work on a
    task immediately. As you most assuredly know already, a few years
    before the Cataclysm the Kingpriest Beldinas and his Order of the
    Divine Hammer instituted the Edict of Thought Control. The Edict
    declared that any texts which conflicted with their faith would be
    destroyed in the name of Paladine. Before the Edict could be
    enforced in our dear library, the heroic Aesthetics of those days
    destroyed the catalogue of books here and sealed up the library to
    keep it safe from Istar's prying eyes. For ages this library had
    been lost, but Gilean has guided our devoted Aesthetics back here
    to restore the catalogue and share centuries of recorded
    knowledge.'

        'There are a few particular books I need you to find for me
    that need to be added to the catalogue. I do hope they are still in
    a readable condition. We are currently cataloguing cultural
    histories and we are looking for a text which describes the
    original races of Krynn, as well as any texts relating to the
    ancient elves. Oh, and I almost forgot the key. This will give you
    access to our storage room should you need any supplies. Praise be
    to the book, and to the balance.'

    It would take a keen eye to find a speck of dust among these
bookshelves after the hard work of the Aesthetics. The shelves appear to go
on forever, housing hundreds of books. Far above the highest shelves there
is a wide metal pipe which runs behind the bookshelves here, which is
likely used for drainage. The surrounding bookshelves, piping and the
balcony above could all make a person feel claustrophobic. There is an
eerie silence about this place, and each footstep echoes almost eternally.

    A stark contrast to the nearby rows, the bookshelves here have been
reduced to a large pile of rubble blocking passage in some directions. The
shelves that are still visible are broken and covered in dust, with many
books lost to the ages. Far above the bookshelf remnants there are wide
skylights that are dark and barely visible, offering no additional light.
The Aesthetics speak of this section with deep sadness, lamenting the
knowledge lost. It is difficult to move without stepping on rocks and
debris and to continue on the path north or east would be impossible.

[36mA Dusty Pile of Rubble[0;37m
    A stark contrast to the nearby rows, the bookshelves here have been
reduced to a large pile of rubble blocking passage in some directions. The
shelves that are still visible are broken and covered in dust, with many
books lost to the ages. Far above the bookshelf remnants there are wide
skylights that are dark and barely visible, offering no additional light.
The Aesthetics speak of this section with deep sadness, lamenting the
knowledge lost. It is difficult to move without stepping on rocks and
debris and to continue on the path north or east would be impossible.

    This row of bookshelves appears to have previously run from west to
east, but all of the bookshelves along the north wall of the library have
been been completely crushed under what looks like a fallen slab of stone
from the balcony above. Not surprisingly the bookshelves along this row
have all been destroyed, and broken remnants of the ancient vallenwood
shelves litter the floor. The path to the west is completely impassable due
to the clutter of collapsed shelves and stone debris. To the east the
remains of the fallen slab lay upon the shattered shelves. There is a
significant amount of rubble and debris scattered about the area.

and the scattered debris from the broken shelves makes it very difficult to
walk around this area. Several books from the shelves lie scattered across
the floor, with many of their pages torn from their bindings. It is still
possible to access some of the books on the upper and lower shelves to the
north and south, as these shelves are only partially destroyed. Before
their collapse this row of bookshelves would have continued to the east,
but now the path is completely impassable. The only remaining exit is to

    It would take a keen eye to find a speck of dust among these
bookshelves after the hard work of the Aesthetics. The shelves appear to go

is a wide metal pipe which runs behind the bookshelves here, which is
likely used for drainage. The surrounding bookshelves, piping and the
balcony above could all make a person feel claustrophobic. There is an
eerie silence about this place, and each footstep echoes almost eternally.

    Rows of bookshelves lead in all directions, with some shelves far out
of reach. The lower shelves within reach appear to be stacked with hundreds
of books. The bookshelves swallow the surrounding light, making it
difficult to make out any titles without searching the shelves more
closely. The Aesthetics have put considerable work into cleaning this space
and organizing the bookshelves.

[36mA Dusty Pile of Rubble[0;37m
    A stark contrast to the nearby rows, the bookshelves here have been
reduced to a large pile of rubble blocking passage in some directions. The
shelves that are still visible are broken and covered in dust, with many
books lost to the ages. Far above the bookshelf remnants there are wide
skylights that are dark and barely visible, offering no additional light.
The Aesthetics speak of this section with deep sadness, lamenting the
knowledge lost. It is difficult to move without stepping on rocks and
debris and to continue on the path north or east would be impossible.

have all been destroyed, and broken remnants of the ancient vallenwood

to the clutter of collapsed shelves and stone debris. To the east the
remains of the fallen slab lay upon the shattered shelves. There is a

    The pervasive stench of sewage immediately overwhelms the senses as a
light shower of foul-smelling water falls from above into this knee-level
pool of filth. Dark figures appear to move in and out of the sewage
suggesting there may be creatures dwelling within the murky waters, but
they could also be just a trick of the darkness. Aside from the occasional
echo of voices and the scurry of footsteps there is only the sound of water
flowing in from above.

up, though the potent stench of sewage remains. Perhaps the lack of water
flowing through here makes this section of the pipe smell worse than the
knee-deep sewage in the other sewer sections. Amidst the dark streaks of
sewage prevalent along the pipe walls there are also streaks and spatters
of a rusty red liquid. The narrow pipe bends to the east, and continues to

[36mSleeping Quarters[0;37m
    In its past use this may have been a meeting room of some sort, however
the Aesthetics and guards appear to have repurposed this room as the
sleeping quarters because of its large size. Beds line the walls with an
obvious delineation between the guards and Aesthetics. The Aesthetics' side
of the room is very utilitarian and sparsely furnished. The guardsman side
of the room has been refurnished using pillows and furniture from
throughout the library to make themselves more comfortable. There are large
sets of doors in the north and south ends of the sleeping quarters and a
smaller doorway in the east wall between the Aesthetic bunks.

    This row of bookshelves appears to have previously run from west to
east, but all of the bookshelves along the north wall of the library have
been been completely crushed under what looks like a fallen slab of stone
from the balcony above. Not surprisingly the bookshelves along this row
have all been destroyed, and broken remnants of the ancient vallenwood
shelves litter the floor. The path to the west is completely impassable due
to the clutter of collapsed shelves and stone debris. To the east the
remains of the fallen slab lay upon the shattered shelves. There is a
significant amount of rubble and debris scattered about the area.

walk around this area. Several books from the shelves lie scattered across
the floor, with many of their pages torn from their bindings. It is still
possible to access some of the books on the upper and lower shelves to the

their collapse this row of bookshelves would have continued to the east,

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

Mountains which lay to the west. Lush, flat plains extend to the east and

boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or

    This section of the stairwell becomes much more steep up above but
descends gracefully to the east toward what appears to be an elegant marble
archway. The stone walls here are lit brightly by torches in sconces every
few feet. Striations in the stone walls and long cracks betray the age of
this staircase, but the stairs appear sturdy and stable.

dangle from the ceiling trim and other hard to reach places. A winding

the east.

[36mA Jagged End of the Balcony[0;37m
    The unending rows of bookshelves on this balcony come to an abrupt end
as the smooth stone becomes shattered rubble at your feet. A cave-in from a
failing support column has crushed the bookshelves, balcony, and whatever
is below under tons of solid stone. Traversing across this rubble would not
be easy without a great deal of effort.

prevents patrons from falling off. The library walls are covered in tall,
ornate bookshelves that are beyond the reach of even the tallest giant.
Upon each bookshelf lies at least a hundred books that have been carefully
organized.

bookshelves on the floor below. Every square inch of the walls are covered
in bookshelves, upon which lie thousands of ancient tomes. Rival to the
Great Library of Palanthas, this library was once thought to have been lost
in the Cataclysm. There is no telling what secrets and wonders lie within

been been completely crushed under what looks like a fallen slab of stone
from the balcony above. Not surprisingly the bookshelves along this row
have all been destroyed, and broken remnants of the ancient vallenwood
shelves litter the floor. The path to the west is completely impassable due
to the clutter of collapsed shelves and stone debris. To the east the
remains of the fallen slab lay upon the shattered shelves. There is a
significant amount of rubble and debris scattered about the area.

shelves stacked in each row. Since the intersection is a reprieve from
bookshelves it has been used as a storage space for old reading tables and
other library equipment. The Aesthetics have put considerable work into
dusting this space and keeping the pathways clear of debris.

    It would take a keen eye to find a speck of dust among these
bookshelves after the hard work of the Aesthetics. There are four
bookshelves in this row, two lower and two upper. The shelves appear to go

echoes almost eternally.

torches secured to the walls by iron sconces every few feet, and the turns

    The narrow stone steps of this staircase are lit every few feet by
torches gently seated in wall sconces. The scattered debris suggests this
staircase is not regularly maintained, but despite this the structure has
withstood the test of time very well, though how long it has been here is
hard to say. The winding stairs continue up to a small metal hatch above,
and descends to the west.

shrubs line the muddy banks of this small, rushing river, and the air here
is slightly colder due to the mist from the river. Although you see no
signs of life in the river from here, several poor looking fishermen walk
along the banks with shoddy poles. The sound of rushing water hangs heavily
in the cold air, and a large wooden bridge crosses the river to the east.

[36mA Dry Old Road[0;37m
    This large road, composed mostly of dry, dusty dirt, winds its way
across the parched yellow grasses of the plains towards Delphon to the
west, and to a crossroad east of here. The wind carries with it the sounds
of Delphon, a large city whose towering black gates glitter in both
darkness and light. Many travelers pass you by, most heading west towards
the great city of Delphon or beginning the trek to Port Balifor which rests
south of here, along the shores of the Khurman Sea. The breeze dies down a
bit, replaced with the cawing of vultures overhead.

    Plains expand all around you from this parched, hot dry road. The dirt
of which the road is made is cracked and dry with lack of moisture, and
very few plants other than the occasional cactus dare grow in such a trying
environment. The odd reptile slithers across the path, and there are very
few opportunities for respite along the road. In the distance to the north,
a camp can be seen.

crossroad is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and merchants
alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on
the Blood Sea northeast of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder
that bandits frequent these roads.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.

here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

meet up with a curved ceiling, and lead westward through a twisting
passage, while to the east the foreboding doors of a temple to the dark

the danger within, though those who wish to follow in the footsteps of
heroes would surely brave on to the dangers of the temple.

    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
