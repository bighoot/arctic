    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

[36mNorthern Avenue[0;37m
    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    The avenue continues to wind north and south through the dense forest
town. The sounds of wildlife abound here, making you feel safe and at
ease. It is almost as if this town has been built in a special place. It
is possible to leave the avenue and venture west here.

    The avenue stretches north and south among the huge vallenwoods. The
limbs of the trees intertwine above you, providing a protective canopy from
the harsh outside world. A very large vallenwood stands at the edge of the
road here. To the east a large clearing with a tremendous vallenwood is
accessible.

    Northern Avenue intersects Perimeter Street here. The avenue leads
north and south, while Perimeter Street appears to loop to the east,
circling above the region Solace is built in. What appears to be a gate is
to the north, while you see signs of Solace to the south.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    This rough road winds its way through foothills near the Khalkist
Mountains which lay to the west. Lush, flat plains extend to the east and
northeast. These hills are green, dotted by the occasional dark grey
boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or
civilization can be seen in sight, as there are few footprints and no wagon
ruts on this rugged road.

Torak is a huge dwarf. His long red beard flows all the way down to his lap.
You notice he is playing with it absent-mindedly. He is dressed in rich robes
and armor. Even though he is old and wise, he is still a match for any hardy
adventurer.
Torak is in an excellent condition.

Torak is using:

You divide 10 coins equally among the group members present.

    A huge shaft opens up to the west, clearly leading down into the heart
of the mountain. A button located against the northern wall seems to have
some significance in the function of the lift. Some lanterns have been set
up to provide light in the cavernous room. To the east the mines of the
dwarven keep continue.

Lanai flies in from the east.
[36mThe Main Lift[0;37m
    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western

[36mBottom of the Main Lift[0;37m
    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of
the mountain above. Complicated gears and pulleys seem to work together in
an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

[36mThe Entrance to Deep Mine[0;37m
    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

[36mJunction One[0;37m
    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of

Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a

Large stalagmites, points upward, rise out of the ground forming this

    Dark gray walls climb to the ceiling of this massive stalagmite.
Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the

    Mud puddles line a path, leading directly into the back of a giant
dragon's mouth. A small opening is easily visible between the skull and the
mandible. The mud here has a strange sweet smell that is surprisingly
pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem
terrifyingly bigger than the ones seen above. Most of the hoofprints seem
to be leading east, where the mud gets thicker.

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

    Viscous streams of the sweet-smelling, orange-tan mud spills forth from
an unseen source above. The result is an absolutely absurd amount of mud in
this room. Looking down, huge body prints have been cast where armaboros
have spent their time recuperating energy. The path to the west looks a
little bit easier to move in, since, here, you are forced to swim.

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

congregate in this area, male armaboros, with breeding rights, will come
here to help propagate the species. The room the north appears a little
less muddy.

[36mA Mud-filled Alcove[0;37m
    This tiny alcove is filled with the rich orange-tan mud seen throughout
the den of the armaboros. The bodyprints in this area suggest that it is an
area given mainly to the female beasts. Of course, since the females
congregate in this area, male armaboros, with breeding rights, will come
here to help propagate the species. The room the north appears a little
less muddy.

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area
below.

an unseen source above. The result is an absolutely absurd amount of mud in
this room. Looking down, huge body prints have been cast where armaboros
have spent their time recuperating energy. The path to the west looks a

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem
terrifyingly bigger than the ones seen above. Most of the hoofprints seem

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the

while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the

brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and

partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will

    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a neighboring
vallenwood tree.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest

dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

[36mThe Tollhouse[0;37m
    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

     The stream gets a bit rough as it flows out into the ocean. The rapids
ahead looks too dangerous to brave. Small hills line either sides of the
wide stream, rocky and rough, they aren't very suitable for growing crops.
There is a small clearing off the stream just to the south, and you see a
narrow path through the trees to the north, but it doesn't look like it has
been maintained over the years.

     As you cut your way through the foliage, you find what looks like the

obviously been trying to wash away its existence for some time and appear
to be succeeding. The path is all but obscured by the weeds growing in it.
The path appears to continue to the north, but it is hard to tell from
here. To the south you hear the trickle of the stream.

     On either side of the path, hidden behind two short trees so they
can't be clearly seen from the stream, are two stone monuments. The
monument to the left is of a solitary man, his face shrouded by his cloak,
leaning gently on a walking staff. A small owl is perched on his right
shoulder. The monument to the right looks to be a simple block of granite,
but you sense it is more than that. Stepping closer, you see what appear to
be shatter marks in the otherwise pristine stone. Laying atop the granite
block is what appears to be a mold for the blade and hilt of a sword. The
trees and grass here is severely overgrown, making you wonder when the last
time someone was through this area.

     Although the underbrush and trees continue to grow carelessly
throughout this area, the path below your feet catches your attention. It
appears to have been carefully cut through this area and rigorously
maintained over the years. You can't remember when the path began, but you
feel certain it wasn't at the two monuments you can still see to the south.
The sound of a stream is still present in the distant, but most of its
music has been swallowed by the trees around you. The path continues to the
west.

     This dirt path is unremarkable in every respect. There are no tracks
of any animals ground into the loose dirt. There are no plants growing
within the confines of the path, though they grow plentifully on either
side. And there is no sign of the path needing grooming of any kind. Oddly,
the path doesn't even need repair after you walk along it, as if it is
impossible to tarnish its unremarkable appearance. To the north you see
what look like two small towers made of granite and crystal, each
positioned on either side of the path.

notice the huts earlier, but then you notice the collection of large rocks,
some crystal, some granite, stacked up on the southern edges of the huts.
You begin to realize that those are the small towers you saw earlier. There
is a pulsing of energy to the north.

     The path comes to a sudden end here, the path to the north occupied by
a large granite and crystal gate. The only direction available to you is
back to the south since the areas to the east and west are blocked by large
boulders. As you examine the boulders closer, you can almost see the
outlines of various arms, legs, heads, and other body parts. Just as you
begin to wonder if your eyes are failing you, you feel an unseen force

     As you suspected earlier the cliff drops off into a small valley, but
that supposition couldn't have prepared you for what lies within that
valley. Jutting out from beneath the far wall of the valley is the edge of
a building, made from the same stone as the valley walls. You suspect that
it goes much further into the wall, but can't be sure from this distance.
Lying between you and that building is a large field, which looks as though
a war once raged upon it. There are signs of a barricade to your right, a
rock slide to the left, and various pits and traps in between. With sudden
abruptness you realize you are standing on the cliff the young druid
sacrificed his life upon in a final spell to end the Celestial War. Surely
the building hidden under the valley wall must be the Celestial Temple he
was trying to protect.

decades old battles hangs around you like an oppressive blanket. The ground
beneath your feet is a lifeless color, everything that once grew here
having been crushed into oblivion under soldiers' feet years earlier. As
you shuffle your feet to get a better look around, the dust you kick up

red crystal, at least on this side. As you run your hands along the almost
frictionless surface, you discover that the block turns to granite halfway
along each side. Gazing atop the statue, you see the figure of a large
Aurinite knight, his shield and sword resting against on the ground before
him, staring passionless at the valley wall. There looks to be a second
figure standing back-to-back with the Aurinite, but you can't tell from

are no signs of tents or resting quarters here, but those must have already
been scavenged. The floor is littered with the signs of a battle, leaving
you to think that the battle that consumed this area of the valley took
this camp as a casualty. As you approach the fire pit, you begin to feel a

given the camp you can see to the south, you believe it is to protect from
the north. Some of the trenches have been filled in with dirt and boulders,
but most are in the same shape they were when they were originally dug.
Although there is no clear evidence who dug them, you feel it was the

     The rock slide continues to the west here, but it appears to taper off
immediately to the east. As you examine the large pile of rocks and
determine it to be unscalable due to its loose nature, you notice two
tracks in the ground below you. They appear to have been made by the legs
of a large sleigh, but it would have had to been weighed down with
something extremely heavy or dragged over this area repeatedly to leave
such deep grooves. Judging from the way the rock slide seems to curve
inward here, you guess that whoever it was using the sleigh was carrying
rocks to the south.

cliff wall, and although you can't scale the rock slide there either, you
might get some answers as to its origin. After hesitating over which way to

     The large rock slide you saw from the cliff overlooking the valley
obviously began here at the valley wall, but it looks anything but natural.
The most obvious sign is the lack of cracks in the cliff on either side of
the rock slide, which would mean it only effected the area that collapsed
and didn't damage the rock centimeters away. But the area reeks of magic
and abnormal causes. You can even see what looks like scorch marks from
repeated lightning bolts on a very small area at the very top of the rock
slide, confirming your suspicion of magical involvement.

     The rock slide you saw from the cliff above the valley, the one that
jutted out from the west wall, comes to an end here, allowing you easy
access to the north again. There is no sign what caused the rock slide this
far from the wall, but it feels unnatural even from this distance. Whatever
force buried the Celestial Temple beneath the valley walls probably
inadvertently caused this rock slide as well. Though you can travel to the
north, west, and south from here, the area immediately to your east has
been cut off by a large pit. Glancing down into the pit you see a
collection of pointed spears, but there are no bodies on the spears
indicating it was ever successfully used.

     The rock slide you saw from the edge of the valley ends here, but it
isn't the mass of stone that captures your attention. This area of the
battle field holds the same signs of the war that plagued the rest of the
valley. There are broken swords, rusted out piece of armour, and various
other pieces of equipment badly in need of repairs. But the war remains
seem deliberately sorted into piles of similar items. Weapons have been
sorted from armour and clothing. By the amount of dust that has collected
on the piles, you guess that whoever did this did so shortly after the war
ended and then left them here unattended.

     Taking up the expanse of land immediately to the south and obscuring

It takes you a moment to realize what it is, and a moment longer for the
oppressive dust to settle. This area of the valley has been thoroughly
cleaned of the remains from the Celestial War. There are no signs of broken
equipment or weaponry. The ground even seems to have been well swept to

     Although the rock slide continues to the south here, your attention is
immediately drawn to one small item in the valley floor. The area has been
completely cleared of all equipment and weapons that might have been left
from the Celestial War, and the ground has been swept clean. What makes
this area truly spectacular is the single flower someone has planted in the
ground. You almost feel as though someone has begun to restore the valley
to the condition it was before the war ravaged it. As you marvel at the
single flower, you notice a dull white fence to the north and beyond it
what appears to be tombstones.

bolt strikes given the pattern of them. You find that your attention is
drawn away from the rock slide and to the north, though. A large gate made
of white metal stands before you. A sign hangs on the side of the gate, but
it is in a language you do not understand. Looking through the gate and

     Although the rock slide continues to the south here, your attention is
immediately drawn to one small item in the valley floor. The area has been
completely cleared of all equipment and weapons that might have been left
from the Celestial War, and the ground has been swept clean. What makes
this area truly spectacular is the single flower someone has planted in the
ground. You almost feel as though someone has begun to restore the valley
to the condition it was before the war ravaged it. As you marvel at the
single flower, you notice a dull white fence to the north and beyond it
what appears to be tombstones.

     Taking up the expanse of land immediately to the south and obscuring

edge of the valley. But something seems wrong about where you are standing.
It takes you a moment to realize what it is, and a moment longer for the
oppressive dust to settle. This area of the valley has been thoroughly
cleaned of the remains from the Celestial War. There are no signs of broken
equipment or weaponry. The ground even seems to have been well swept to
clear the excess rubble caused from the rock slide.

[36mEdge of the Rock Slide[0;37m
     The rock slide you saw from the edge of the valley ends here, but it
isn't the mass of stone that captures your attention. This area of the
battle field holds the same signs of the war that plagued the rest of the
valley. There are broken swords, rusted out piece of armour, and various
other pieces of equipment badly in need of repairs. But the war remains
seem deliberately sorted into piles of similar items. Weapons have been
sorted from armour and clothing. By the amount of dust that has collected
on the piles, you guess that whoever did this did so shortly after the war
ended and then left them here unattended.

[36mCorner of the Celestial Temple[0;37m
     The Celestial Temple comes to a corner here, proceeding off to the
northeast and northwest and disappearing into the valley walls. The temple
looks to be symmetrical down both edges, but you can see no traces of an
entrance. There are obvious signs of the Celestial War marring the
otherwise pristine walls of the temple, but no breaks that would indicate a
way in. In a sudden rush of fear, it occurs to you that the entrance might
be locked forever underneath the rock which covers the rest of the temple.
There appears to be the outline of a door here, but you can't be sure.

[36mThe Celestial Valley[0;37m
    The Celestial Temple that drew you to this valley lies along the path
here, taking up most of the area to the northeast. Its surface is made from
the same stone that the valley walls are made of, telling you the Fyzians
didn't go far for construction materials. The temple comes to a corner
immediately to the west of you, but you can also step closer by going
north. There are no immediate signs of battle to the south, but you know
the Celestial War once raged there. The exit to the east is cut off my a
deep ditch that you could probably climb down into but certainly couldn't
climb back out of because of the ground's loose nature.

[36mThe Celestial Valley[0;37m
    The Celestial Temple takes up most of the area to the north, from
immediately to the west to directly north. Its surface, although marred by
the war between the Aurinites and Gargoyles, has obviously had limited
repairs done to it. Some areas are of a slightly lighter color, making you
think the stone there is much more recent than the majority of the temple's
dark brown. There are no signs of who took it upon themselves to repair the
temple, but you can't help but feel it was the Fyzians who originally built

after the young druid who befriended them cast his final spell.

[36mNear a Wall of Spears[0;37m
     You can see where the valley wall meets the Celestial Temple to the
north, the temple continuing for an untold length into the wall. From this
distance it almost appears as though the valley wall came alive and tried
to consume the temple, but only succeeded in getting most of it before its
mouth was full. Blocking your path to the east is a large wall of about a
hundred spears, some topped with granite, others will crystal. The spears
have been stuck into the ground at various angles to each other, providing
a line of defense no matter which side you happen to be on. It would also
make an effective impaling point if an enemy were driven into it. As the
path continues to the north, you can see the ground get softer and darker
in color as if from moisture.

     The valley changes climate abruptly here, going from the dust covered
near desert elsewhere to a marshland. The ground beneath your feet has some
give to it from the moisture in it. There are no signs of plants or
wildlife in the area, but you sense that they are more likely to spring up
here than elsewhere in the valley. You inhale deeply, reveling in the scent
of life and moisture instead of death and decay. Since the rest of the
valley resembles more of a wasteland due to the war, you can't help feel
that someone created this marshland in an effort to restore the valley. To
the north the Celestial Temple meets the valley wall, disappearing from
your sight. To the east you see signs of a camp.

[36mWithin a Large Abandoned Camp[0;37m
     Although this was probably a major camp during the war, possible a
headquarters for one of the two armies, it has long since been abandoned
and lost the importance it once held. There is a fire pit here filled with
logs that haven't been lit in years, if not decades. There is some doubt in
your mind that they will ever light again due to the moisture that now
hangs in the air. This area, like the ones to the west and south, is more a
marshland than the desert the valley has become. You wonder absentmindedly
if the camp was once much larger but was destroyed to make way for the
restoration project. The camp continues to the east, and there is a large
tent still erected to the north.

     There is no telling who once used this camp or for what purpose, but
you can't help feel that the camp was once much larger. From the position
of the few remaining logs and the large pit that is half filled by the
valley wall, it almost looks as though the camp once proceeded beyond the
walls of this valley. For that to be true, it would mean that the walls
either closed voluntarily due to the passage of time, or somebody cast a
spell that moved them. Either way it goes a long way in explaining why the
Celestial Temple no longer stands in the open but has been swallowed up by
the valley.

     The ground beneath your feet gives way slowly to your weigh, sinking
with a satisfying sigh. It saddens you that this marsh-like surface ends
immediately to the south, where it gives way to the dried and broken land
that covers the rest of the valley. Obviously whatever effort was put into
restoring this area hasn't yet been applied to the rest of the valley. To
the north you see what looks like the remains of a camp, but its hard to
tell with so little evidence left behind. To the east is more of the
marshland, much like this small section. To the west you can see the
massive valley wall reaching almost gracefully into the sky above.

     Although the dried and dead land continues to the valley wall here,
there is the smell of something greater in the air. It seems to be
emanating from both the west and the south, but much stronger to the south.
Your faith that something might be truly alive here is almost restored when
you see the indentations in the wall. The are slightly bigger than a head
with a helmet, and that is exactly what you think caused them. There are
approximately a dozen holes here, leading you to believe that either one
person had his head drilled repeatedly into the walls or this just a
convenient place to perform that task on multiple people. Either way the
sight puts a momentary damper on the scent of life in the air.

you are amazed to see the first signs of life in the valley. The dried and
cracked land beneath your feet yields before grass covered ground. The dust
and death in the air almost visibly ends, giving way to moisture and life.
To the east is the valley wall, and it too takes on a lighter appearance as
your eyes wander south, the stone seeming to grow less oppressive with

to protect is the source of this sudden change.

give to it from the moisture in it. There are no signs of plants or
wildlife in the area, but you sense that they are more likely to spring up
here than elsewhere in the valley. You inhale deeply, reveling in the scent
of life and moisture instead of death and decay. Since the rest of the
valley resembles more of a wasteland due to the war, you can't help feel
that someone created this marshland in an effort to restore the valley. To
the north the Celestial Temple meets the valley wall, disappearing from
your sight. To the east you see signs of a camp.

north, the temple continuing for an untold length into the wall. From this
distance it almost appears as though the valley wall came alive and tried
to consume the temple, but only succeeded in getting most of it before its

hundred spears, some topped with granite, others will crystal. The spears
have been stuck into the ground at various angles to each other, providing
a line of defense no matter which side you happen to be on. It would also
make an effective impaling point if an enemy were driven into it. As the

if the camp was once much larger but was destroyed to make way for the
restoration project. The camp continues to the east, and there is a large
tent still erected to the north.

[36mWithin a Large Abandoned Camp[0;37m
     There is no telling who once used this camp or for what purpose, but
you can't help feel that the camp was once much larger. From the position
of the few remaining logs and the large pit that is half filled by the
valley wall, it almost looks as though the camp once proceeded beyond the
walls of this valley. For that to be true, it would mean that the walls
either closed voluntarily due to the passage of time, or somebody cast a
spell that moved them. Either way it goes a long way in explaining why the
Celestial Temple no longer stands in the open but has been swallowed up by
the valley.

[36mMarshlands[0;37m
     The ground beneath your feet gives way slowly to your weigh, sinking
with a satisfying sigh. It saddens you that this marsh-like surface ends
immediately to the south, where it gives way to the dried and broken land
that covers the rest of the valley. Obviously whatever effort was put into
restoring this area hasn't yet been applied to the rest of the valley. To
the north you see what looks like the remains of a camp, but its hard to
tell with so little evidence left behind. To the east is more of the
marshland, much like this small section. To the west you can see the
massive valley wall reaching almost gracefully into the sky above.

[36mAt the Valley Wall[0;37m
     Although the dried and dead land continues to the valley wall here,
there is the smell of something greater in the air. It seems to be
emanating from both the west and the south, but much stronger to the south.
Your faith that something might be truly alive here is almost restored when
you see the indentations in the wall. The are slightly bigger than a head
with a helmet, and that is exactly what you think caused them. There are
approximately a dozen holes here, leading you to believe that either one
person had his head drilled repeatedly into the walls or this just a
convenient place to perform that task on multiple people. Either way the
sight puts a momentary damper on the scent of life in the air.

     The large barricade ends to the southeast, but you can continue to the
south into the area it was made to protect. As you look in that direction,
you are amazed to see the first signs of life in the valley. The dried and
cracked land beneath your feet yields before grass covered ground. The dust
and death in the air almost visibly ends, giving way to moisture and life.
To the east is the valley wall, and it too takes on a lighter appearance as
your eyes wander south, the stone seeming to grow less oppressive with
every centimeter. You begin to wonder if whatever the barricade was erected
to protect is the source of this sudden change.

     The first thing you notice here is the air and the way it seems to hug
you almost lovingly, welcoming you to the one area of the valley that
survived the Celestial War. Your attitude much improved by the change in
atmosphere, the grass covering the ground beneath you seems more a carpet
ushering you further south than a miracle of life. There are no signs of
anything alive bigger than a caterpillar, but that doesn't matter. After
the oppressive cloud of death hanging over the rest of the valley, even the
simplest life seems a gift.

     Placed into the Valley wall just north of the crude barricade is a
Celestial Gate. There is no telling if the gate is a natural occurrence in
the wall or was placed there by somebody, but it is a stunning sight
nonetheless. There are no signs that the Celestial War ever raged here,
making you think that the barricade, as unattractive and disorderly as it
is, at least protected this area of the valley. You can even see the
beginnings of life before the gate itself as a half dozen flowers have
begun to bloom.

remainder of this room is basically spartan. Hanging in the air foot above
your head are three arrows, one pointing towards each of the three exits.
The east arrow has the word "Legends" written on it. The north arrow has
the word "Land." The south arrow has the word "Portal." Obviously this is
an important crossroad in the Temple.

Suppressing another shiver, you look around the room. This section of the

visual history of the temple. You notice that there is very little space
for any additional events to be chiseled, meaning either the prophets
expect little else to happen or the temple is nearing the end of its
existence. If it is the latter, you can't help but feel that a great

     This room, like its three companions, is spartan to the point of
bareness. The walls are plain and undecorated, the floor is covered with a
fine layer of dirt to serve as a carpet of sorts, and there are only two
torches in the room to illuminate it. The wooden furniture looks almost as
thought it is about to fall apart, which doesn't really surprise you. As
you turn to leave, you notice a large half-moon chiseled above the door.

     The first thing you notice is the large tracks in the white dust below
your feet. Whereas the rest of the dust in the temple seems to settle as
soon as people pass through it, the dust here has obviously been disturbed
too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high
traffic area, though there is no way to tell why from here. There is a
large yellow crystal door to the west, one of only a few in the Temple.

     Although you suspect that this chamber was meant to be the same
pristine white marble as the rest of the Temple, something must have
happened here recently to change that. Sections of the walls are covered
with a light red, almost as if blood was splashed on the wall and then
partially washed off. Whatever happened to cause this, it happened
recently. On a whim you glance upward and notice that the source of the
stain seems to be the floor above, almost as if the blood seeped through
the floor.

of the chamber change into yellow crystal. The chamber to the north also
seems to be brighter than the one you are in, almost as if it has a light

shoulder. He is surrounded by laughing children and joyful adults. On the
west wall is the dark image of a man in black leather armor with the fire
of insanity in his eyes. He is surrounded by undead, creatures with four
arms, and large eyes with wings.

to realize it is dye from hymox plants. Nearly hidden in the purple haze is
the village, it streets crowded with distraught and depressed Fyzians.
Neither the insane warrior nor the young druid are in these scenes. Below
the hymox dye is the small outline of the Celestial Temple, though it was
obviously added as an afterthought.

guard you've seen in the realm.

    You are at the corner of a large lake, which fills your vision far to
the west before ending at high, jagged cliffs. The forest of pine that this
trail winds through thins out to the north and east, where large fields of
grain can be seen. The pine-covered trail follows the shoreline to the
south into thicker woods and north.

    You are on a narrow trail that cuts between large fields of grain and
the huge vallenwood trees that cover the Solace Vale. Stretching out to the
north, these fields are known as Nearfields to the citizens of Solace
because of their proximity to the small town. A thick forest of pine trees
lies to the west, beyond which the Crystalmir Lake can be seen. To the east
this dirt trail merges with a wide road.

    A narrow road leads deep into a thick forest of very tall trees and
north it leads through the plains of Abanasinia. Around you are many trees
but not as many as to the south. The road runs in the near shadows of the
Kharolis mountains which can be seen off to the west, beyond a great lake.
The mountains appear to run north for some distance before ending. The
plains spread out to the north from here for many leagues.

    This narrow, dirt road winds its way through the great forest, curving
around large trees and rocks. You can hear the chattering of hundreds of
animals all around you, and a few of the trees seem to have large claw
marks. To the south, lies the northern gate of Solace, and to the north,
the road continues. Large bushes block your view to the east and west.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

school for budding warriors lies to the west while a clearing on a junction
of boughs can be seen to the east. You have a strange feeling that you are

excellent hiding spots for those skilled in being unseen. The trunk of this
massive vallenwood lies back to the north, and can be reached easily by the
footholds and handholds in the bough leading down.

    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a neighboring

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

[36mA Mountain Road[0;37m
    To the north is a sheer drop off the side of the mountain. High winds
threaten to blow you off the side of the mountain and you quickly realize
that, even flying, your chances of surviving a step off the cliff would be
minimal. To the south, a small path between the keep and some boulders back
towards the main gate of the keep. Off to the west, a small ledge winds its
way between the keep walls and a sheer drop-off. It might be safe to go
that way, but you wonder if you should risk it. To the east, the winding
road leads down the mountain.

[36mBefore Some Ruined Brass Gates[0;37m
    Before you stand two huge brass gates which once guarded the entrance
to Thorbardin. However, a terrible earthquake has caused the passageway
beyond the gates to collapse, sealing off the entrance forever. The giant
gates have fallen off their hinges and lean forlornly against the piles of
rubble. Although the passage into the kingdom is destroyed, the indomitable
mountain known as Cloudseeker still stands, reaching towards the sky. To
the north and south, narrow paths lead around the cliffs surrounding the
mountain, and a sloping path to the east leads back down the mountain.

[36mA Tight Passage[0;37m
    The passage way between the mountain walls and the piles of boulders
is just wide enough for a fair-size adventuring party to pass through. The
boulders look unsteady and you would hate to have to climb up on them, but
thankfully don't look like there will be an avalanche. To the north, the
path opens up and you can see a set of ruined gates, while to the south,
the tight passageway continues through the barren mountain range.

    The passage between the walls of the mountain and the rocks and rubble

opens up a bit, occasionally funneling a strong wind through.

    There is a fair-size clearing here, but as you look north and west, you
see the passageways are much tighter. To the north, there is a passage
between the walls of the mountain and a bunch of boulders and rubble piled
high. Westward, a small path winds its way into the depths of the Kharolis
Mountains, passing between a mountainside and jagged cliffs. To the south,
a steep, but usable path leads down to the road near Tarsis.

foot of an impossibly tall mountain lies a few steps to the north.

nature playing tricks on the mind. The unusually flat ground continues and
expands to the west, while a narrow gap between the giant boulders off to
the south allows relatively easy movement in that direction.

resilient enough to make it past the first line of defenses will be forced
to suddenly turn right, which makes fighting very awkward for right-handed
fighters, to ascend the huge spiral ramp that leads into Thorbardin.

of the ramp is unpaved, but smooth except for the parallel tracks designed
to accommodate merchant carts. A few murder holes are hidden in the wall to
aid in repelling would-be attackers foolish to attempt an invasion.

are grizzled and crossed with scars, a testament to the hard life of a

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the big chains in the transport shafts, but almost none of them bother to
stop on this level. The high ceiling and the archways leading away from
the station are unusually tall for dwarven architecture, as if this area
is designed to accommodate the needs of bigger races. Sturdy wooden boards
block movement through the archways in all directions except north.

of steel coins being dropped into strongboxes. In contrast, there is only
silence beyond the sturdy archway that leads off to the east.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a dwarf steps off on
this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must
have fallen off contraptions being transported to other parts of the huge
mountain kingdom. Unlike gnomish parts, these spare parts are as finely
made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

    This large square has been carefully carved out of the limestone, and
it was once a beautiful testament to dwarven stonework. Now, however, the
scratched stone floor is littered with loose gears, broken tools, random
screws and half-finished contraptions. The famed Hylar engineers must work
in the nearby buildings, perfecting the technology that the dwarves use to
defend their mountain home and keep their mighty kingdom running.

made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

again on display, this time tempered with mahogany accents that make the
room less blinding to stand in. Besides the antechamber to the west, the
only other exit is a small platinum door on the north side of the hall. It
seems like the owner of this home ran out of money, since there aren't any
doors in the doorways in the gilded walls to the east and south.

level so that a well-dressed dwarf or two can step off. The station walls
are lined with platinum and gold panels, suggesting that the dwarves who
live here must be among the wealthiest in Thorbardin. Elaborate carvings
adorn the impressive doors set in the magnificent archways to the east and

    Characterized by high vaulted ceilings and polished granite walls, this
grand antechamber creates a sense of awe in those arriving to see the hylar
thane. A cluster of velvet couches and chaises enables guests to sit and
socialize while they wait for an audience with their host. The pink granite
archway to the north leads deeper into the residence, while the masterfully
crafted wooden doors at the south end of the antechamber guard the exit.

at his table, as equals, rather than from a throne--at least when he's here

audience hall are clad in grey granite paneling, and polished granite tiles

[36mThe Audience Hall[0;37m
    The eyes of anyone who enters the audience hall are immediately drawn
to the massive hickory table at the northern end. Flanked by comfortable
chairs on either side, it seems the thane must prefer to receive his guests
at his table, as equals, rather than from a throne--at least when he's here
in his private residence instead of the Court of Thanes. The walls of the
audience hall are clad in grey granite paneling, and polished granite tiles
cover the floor. A wide hallway to the south leads away from the hall.

on protocol and hyperconscious to the slightest insult, it's not surprising
how precisely every table setting is laid out--or the fact that the table
is round instead of long, as would be the case in most traditional banquet
halls. The main hall lies to the south, beyond a row of marble columns.

    This finely appointed banquet hall is the ideal setting for a formal
dwarven state dinner. Since dwarves are famously known for being sticklers
on protocol and hyperconscious to the slightest insult, it's not surprising
how precisely every table setting is laid out--or the fact that the table
is round instead of long, as would be the case in most traditional banquet
halls. The main hall lies to the south, beyond a row of marble columns.

    Featuring a gracefully arching vaulted ceiling and parallel rows of
majestic marble columns, this magnificent hall is truly a wonder to behold.
Intricate patterns of gold and silver filigree dance across the columns,
each more complex and beautiful than the last. The columns clearly direct
any visitors to head west towards the Court of Thanes, though it would be
easy enough to detour north towards the wondrous banquet hall as well.

brought to the Council of Thanes for questioning, this guardroom doesn't
stink of musk and urine like most prisons. The spartan room is equipped
with only a desk, a couple of chairs and a simple weapons rack. The cell
lies through the sturdy steel door to the west, while the narrow archway
to the north leads back to the main halls of this level.

[36mThe Banquet Hall[0;37m
    This finely appointed banquet hall is the ideal setting for a formal
dwarven state dinner. Since dwarves are famously known for being sticklers
on protocol and hyperconscious to the slightest insult, it's not surprising
how precisely every table setting is laid out--or the fact that the table
is round instead of long, as would be the case in most traditional banquet
halls. The main hall lies to the south, beyond a row of marble columns.

the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this

making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

The half-elves of Krynn are the offspring of human and elven parents and
due to this mixed heritage they are frowned upon by both cultures.
Half-elves strongly resemble their elven parent, but unlike the elven race,
males can grow facial hair. They are slightly taller and somewhat stockier
than most elves. Half-elves inherit the dexterity of their elven parents.

Since most are raised in an atmosphere of shame, half-elves tend to be
insecure, which often leads to rebellious or anti-social behavior. Most
half elves are natural leaders but few feel worthy of the responsibility or
are given the opportunity. All half-elves are loners - brooding, quiet, and
struggling with self doubt.

Note that despite what elves are like in fantasy books and other games,
elves are not long lived here. They have the same lifespan as humans.

Classes Available to half elves:
Warrior         Paladin         Dark Knight     Thief           Scout
Cleric          Druid           Shaman          Magic User

Alignment Restrictions:
none

Half-Elf Key Attributes:
Dexterity

Racial Bonus:
Half-elves receive an improved regeneration rate, though less than human.

EXOTIC RACE: HALF-OGRE

       NOTE: The half-ogre are an exotic race. Please see HELP EXOTIC RACES
             for more information.

The ogres of Krynn are known to be vicious and cruel with dark hearts and
ugly, unattractive features but incredible strength and towering height.
The half-ogres, few though they may be, have much in common with their
forebears in appearance and are only slightly diminished in size. Unwelcome
in most civilized places, the life of a half-ogre is not an easy one but
their prowess in combat makes them viable in any effort of violence or war.

Half-ogres, due to their strength, are fearsome combatants in melee combat
and given their unfortunate appearances, they have endured many hardships,
allowing them to take a great deal of beatings and punishment before
surrendering, but any outcast would accept death over defeat.

Their uncommon strength and constitution makes them ideal barbarians, dark
knights and warriors. Although they suffer from poor dexterity, when they
do land a blow, they certainly make it count. Though only of average
intelligence and wisdom, there are many half-ogres who have gone on to
become clerics and their fearsomeness is a boon to all half-ogre shamans.

Classes Available to half-ogres:
Barbarian        Warrior         Dark Knight       Cleric        Shaman
Scout

Alignment Restrictions:
Cannot follow good alignments.

Half-Ogre Key Attributes:
Strength, Constitution

Racial Bonus:
Half-Ogre receive a damage bonus to melee combat.

some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the

are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.
