    The low ceiling holds the smoke and noise close to the floor in this
busy inn. A dozen long tables stand scattered about the room and a narrow
stair in the back leads to the upper floor. Along the south wall, a
fieldstone hearth holds a rotating spit. Several groups of adventurers are
clustered about the various tables, each eying the others suspiciously and
planning their campaigns in muted tones.

mighty cliffs, defiant against the cold, harsh winds, and dwarfed only by
the fifty foot towers that nearly encircle the city. The ancient city walls
have withstood the tests of time, including the Cataclysm in all of its
fiery glory. Once called Tarsis the Beautiful, the Lordcity was a bustling
sea port, whose rich commerce brought sustainability and prosperity to the
land. The city now looks as desolate as the plains that surround it.
Tempestuous winds assail the walls with endless specks of sand, causing

plunging eastward through the plains and west towards the exotic city of
Tarsis. Glacial winds gust in from the south, hampering your journey. The
plains respond to these forceful winds, born in the heart of Icewall, with
incredible dust storms that constantly threaten to encroach upon Tarsis and
the roads leading to her. Very few plants have the will or tenacity to try
growing on these rocky soils, and the slightest green of a stubborn moss is

[36mA Scenic Road[0;37m
    Although the Plains of Dust are generally barren and frigid, this scenic
road offers a pleasant view of the surrounding valley. The hard-packed road
winds through the gradually sloping hills, which helps protect you from the
sharp, crisp breeze flowing in from the south. Lone pine trees and shrubs
dot the hillsides and struggle for survival in this barren wasteland. The
trees remind you of the tenacity of the barbarians and nomads that inhabit
much of the inhospitable region. The road continues through the valley to
the west, and rises gently as it cuts through the hills to the north.

    The edge of a great forest lies to the south, filled with ancient
and beautiful trees, wildlife, and the revered home of the Silvanesti elves.
The trees and foliage provide an impassable barrier to entering the forest
from here, forming a natural border with the rest of the world. To the east
and west, a well travelled path continues east along the edge of the forest,
and west to an intersection. To the north, you can see the plains of Blode
in the distance, which are home to towns and cities alike.

    The beating sun bakes the dirt road in such heat that the road has

careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only
option is to continue either north or south.

    The path enters the woods at the easiest point, directly to the north.
The trees there are spaced out and not as thick and tall as the trees that
flank the path. The path is wide and well used, there are no danger signs
so you assume that the way north is a safe one.

[36mThe Main Lift[0;37m
    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

Lanai flies in from the west.
[36mBottom of the Main Lift[0;37m
    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of
the mountain above. Complicated gears and pulleys seem to work together in
an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

[36mThe Entrance to Deep Mine[0;37m
    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

taking care of this group of swine and filth. A small fire burns in the

    Dark gray walls climb to the ceiling of this massive stalagmite.
Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the

    The walls in this portion of the stalagmite are very different from
those previously encountered. There are no smooth curves, bumps, or odd
colors. Coffee-colored walls surround this small cavern and capture the
moist air and smells that waft in from other areas of the stalagmite. This
bubble in the stalagmite appears to contain less moisture than the other
ones, but it still has collected several small puddles on the floor. Cloved
hoofprints can be found all over, none leading in any particular direction.

too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room. The
path through the den leads to the east.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

DWARVEN KEEP
============

BACKGROUND:

A lone group of dwarves have established a keep within a small mountain
range.  They have closed off all access and do not allow visitors, but
rumor has it that they have a rich mine within the mountain and are
hoarding all the wealth to themselves, just as dwarves are prone to do.
No one has been able to sneak into the keep and discover the truth, it
is heavily guarded.

The dwarves are skilled architects and are fiercely proud and the keep
and mines are superb examples of crafted stonework.  As such, the keep
is likely to be impenetrable to siege-style tactics.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The dwarven keep and mine are suitable for mid-level players [12-20] and
groups.

LOCATION:

The keep and mine are located in the rugged southern Khalkist mountains
to the north of the land of ogres.

[36mBehind the Dragon's Skull[0;37m
    Mud puddles line a path, leading directly into the back of a giant
dragon's mouth. A small opening is easily visible between the skull and the
mandible. The mud here has a strange sweet smell that is surprisingly
pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem
terrifyingly bigger than the ones seen above. Most of the hoofprints seem
to be leading east, where the mud gets thicker.

Lanai flies in from the west.
[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

    Viscous streams of the sweet-smelling, orange-tan mud spills forth from
an unseen source above. The result is an absolutely absurd amount of mud in
this room. Looking down, huge body prints have been cast where armaboros
have spent their time recuperating energy. The path to the west looks a
little bit easier to move in, since, here, you are forced to swim.

    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes

    Viscous streams of the sweet-smelling, orange-tan mud spills forth from
an unseen source above. The result is an absolutely absurd amount of mud in
this room. Looking down, huge body prints have been cast where armaboros
have spent their time recuperating energy. The path to the west looks a
little bit easier to move in, since, here, you are forced to swim.

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

    The long road through the stalagmite fields comes to an abrupt end at
the base of an incredibly large stalagmite. Deep grooves along the length
of the monolith are filled with colonies of subterranean lichens. In the
road some strange hoof-like footprints have been left. They seem to lead
right into the stalagmite. The road through the stalagmite fields leads to

holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a

unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,

Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

[36mJunction Three[0;37m
    A clear junction spot of the Main Way, the area is labeled with a huge
sign reading only the number three. Huge tread marks in the ground lead to
the north and west, clearly paths for mining carts along the Main Way.
Surprisingly, the tunnel east, while plenty big enough for the carts, has
no tracks leading in that direction. Villagers are plentiful in the area of
this junction, some chatting wildly with each other, while others sit on
the benches, which have been erected around the junction sign. Torches
bring an abundance of light to this underground tunnel.

    'Two' is written on a large sign on the eastern wall of the tunnel

torches above the sign. Many of the villagers walk about here. A group of
merchants mills around, having recently arrived from the main elevator
shaft, which lies directly to the west. To the north and south the Main Way
continues. The Deep Mine Main Shaft is the clear way back to the mountain
surface.

[36mJunction One[0;37m
    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

[36mDeep Mine Main Way[0;37m
    The wide tunnel of the Main Way continues through this much more
residential area of the village. At first glance it appears as the rest of
the main tunnel but little doors in the tunnel, reveal homes dug into the
side walls. Deep treads in the center of the road, indicate the path of the
mining carts to both the west and south. Mounted torches, light this region
from the ceiling down. The way south leads to a junction in the tunnel,
while the way west moves through the residential district.

[36mDeep Mine Main Way[0;37m
    In this residential area of Deep Mine, some homes have been dug
directly into the side of the tunnel. Against the western wall, however, a
large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.
Torches set near the ceiling, brighten this residential area.

[36mThe Golden Lane[0;37m
    While dubbed the 'Golden Lane', this slender tunnel-path hardly passes
as anything greater than an alley. And though completely extravagant, gold
is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

The floor is made of fine marble that has been immaculately cleaned,

[36mWithin an Empty Mansion[0;37m
    Smooth white-washed stone walls characterize this spectacular mansion.
The floor is made of fine marble that has been immaculately cleaned,
polished, and glossed. Although there are no furnishings yet, this adds to
the spacious feeling within the mansion. A fine layer of dust coats the
area, as it is not yet visited by anyone outside of the construction guild.
The only real thing of note is the extremely odd contraption set into the
northern wall. Clearly a device of the Engineering Guild, it is unclear at
first glance what it actually does. The mansion can be exited to the east.

Extending from all four of the wide frontal windows are stone balconies.
Low walls enclose each, preventing the residents from falling. Debris still
lies scattered about, with particular concentration on the front steps and
lower balconies of the mansion.

[36mThrough the Construction[0;37m
    Signs of active construction surround the area; hammers and picks
of disparate size lay besides boards of wood and piles of smooth stone
used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious
dwellings dominate the surrounding area, their size accomodated for easily
by the cavernous ceilings overhead. The sounds of banging and shouting
fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the
residents. Judging by the pace the Construction Guild works at, that time
is not far off.

[36mBefore a Finished Mansion[0;37m
    The expanding Golden Lane abruptly halts at the front of an impressive
new mansion. The tunnel floor has been cleared of the vast majority of its
rubble, yet there is still the feel of construction. Expensive pieces of
furniture are continually being pushed through the beautiful doors of the
new mansion, and the banging of hammers and scraping of stone can be
readily heard in all directions. While most of the work seems to be on
surrounding structures, a few dwarves work to polish off the external and
internal parts of the mansion. A soft white light illuminates the area from
above. A solid wooden door, with a labelling of crossed tools, serves as
the entrance to a temporary toolshed, used by the construction guild. To
the south the construction continues.

[36mBefore a Finished Mansion[0;37m
    The expanding Golden Lane abruptly halts at the front of an impressive
new mansion. The tunnel floor has been cleared of the vast majority of its
rubble, yet there is still the feel of construction. Expensive pieces of
furniture are continually being pushed through the beautiful doors of the
new mansion, and the banging of hammers and scraping of stone can be
readily heard in all directions. While most of the work seems to be on
surrounding structures, a few dwarves work to polish off the external and
internal parts of the mansion. A soft white light illuminates the area from
above. A solid wooden door, with a labelling of crossed tools, serves as
the entrance to a temporary toolshed, used by the construction guild. To
the south the construction continues.

[36mThrough the Construction[0;37m
    Signs of active construction surround the area; hammers and picks
of disparate size lay besides boards of wood and piles of smooth stone
used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious
dwellings dominate the surrounding area, their size accomodated for easily
by the cavernous ceilings overhead. The sounds of banging and shouting
fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the
residents. Judging by the pace the Construction Guild works at, that time
is not far off.

carve the stone ceiling into a well-formed arch, adding a more official look

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

    Quite suddenly, the Golden Lane tunnel, which lies through the gate to
the east, has transformed from a dwarf-made structure into this beautiful
natural cavern. High above, stalagtites hang down, yet appear sturdy.
Around the quartz-gravelled path lie large sections of layered, multi-hued
bedrock, complete with naturally eroded holes. To the north a large
stalagmite spikes out of the ground. Embedded on its surface is a small
golden plaque. To the west the garden expands.

The cavern's ceiling is a good forty dwarves from the present ground

direct westward progress. In the southeast corner of the path here is a
medium-sized marble bench. This would certainly prove a comfortable place

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

Nearly a decade has passed since the original construction of this palace.
King Torak recently invested a heavy chunk of the dwarven treasury towards
a series of upgrades and maintenance projects, resulting in the current
glorious state of the palace. The palace itself has dimensions of a
half-thousand meters squared, and has been constructed in perfect
symmetry. Door sized windows with the curtains drawn line up and down the
dual level, white-washed walls of the palace. Statuettes that depict the
dwarven kings of old stare down at you with pride from atop the roof of the
palace. A majestic entryway greets newcomers to the south with massive
columns of granite crowned by perfect marble arches.

    The majestic retreat of King Torak stands proudly just meters away.
Nearly a decade has passed since the original construction of this palace.
King Torak recently invested a heavy chunk of the dwarven treasury towards
a series of upgrades and maintenance projects, resulting in the current
glorious state of the palace. The palace itself has dimensions of a
half-thousand meters squared, and has been constructed in perfect
symmetry. Door sized windows with the curtains drawn line up and down the
dual level, white-washed walls of the palace. Statuettes that depict the
dwarven kings of old stare down at you with pride from atop the roof of the
palace. A majestic entryway greets newcomers to the south with massive
columns of granite crowned by perfect marble arches.

[36mEntryway[0;37m
    King Torak has been known to pass judgements based on first
appearances. Apparently Torak had this in mind when he ordered the addition
of this awing entryway to the palace. The entryway consists of a dozen
granite columns lined up on both the left and right hand sides. Columns on
opposite sides are paired together by magnificiently perfect marble arches
that were constructed without a drop of cement to hold them together. The
arches are held together solely by the massive pressure each brick exerts
on the other. Suspended on top of the arches is a domed quartz roof that
casts a bright hue down upon the lavish red carpet that has been rolled out
here. An honor guard post has been set up just south of here to monitor the
entrance of visitors. At the end of the open aired entryway stand large
golden doors leading into the palace. Above the doors a massive seal of the
dwarven kings occupies the remaining space.

to supervise, and log who enters and exits the palace. The posts smooth
brick walls have had images of the prestigious honorguard's role throughout
history chiselled into them. A marble table with neatly stacked log books
and official looking papers stands in the middle of the post. A few chairs
line the eastern wall, and glass windows facing out into the entryway allow
those in the room to view, and stop if necessary, newcomers to the palace.

designed it in such a way that sound would barely travel. It would seem
that someone, most likely the King, did not want to be disturbed by the
sounds of dwarves marching through this hall. Bright torches illuminate the

line of dwarven monarchs. The hall continues west deep into the heart of

Torak gathers to hold audience with the common dwarves who seek his
jurisprudence. The House of Nobles also reunites here to hold council when
Torak summons them. At the front of the room stand a line of throne like
chairs that host the royal family. Three chairs in the middle stand at a
higher ground than the others, but even these are at different heights. The
highest, largest, and most intricate chair is that of the King. To it's
right the second highest, and largest chair belongs to the heir to the
throne. To the left standing slightly above the others is the chair of the
King's consort. A red carpet extends from the doors to the chamber to just
before the steps leading to the King's throne. To the left and right of the
carpet are rows of chairs for guests and nobles to assist the proceedings.
Torches illuminate the chamber, and a large tapestry reveals its beautiful
patterns in the bright light. The grand hall extends to the east back
towards the entryway.

diagonal arches supporting a hemispherical roof. The four arches meet
every five meters as the hall extends to form four perpendicular angles.
The floor beneath you is made of smooth, flowing marble. Bright torches
illuminate the hall and a beautiful, polished suit of armour left over
from the Dwarf Gate Wars stands silently watching you. To the north a
grand stairway unfolds itself, while to the west the hall continues with
all sorts of paintings, artifacts, and glorious memorabilia of the

A series of murals depicting dwarven culture have been carefully etched

    Just south of the grand stairway a hall opens up here expanding
westwards to the royal apartments. The hall is quite wide given the
relatively small amount of traffic it receives. This part of the palace
is frequented usually only by the royal family and their servants. Light
streaming from a pyromancer carving illuminates the passage. Immaculate
marble floors, and diagonal arches supporting a domed roof remain the
trademark of the palace here. A gorgeous array of flowers stands against
the eastern wall, while the southern wall is adorned by a painting of the
entire royal family together.

alternating rows of amethysts, emeralds, and sapphires adding beautiful
color to the pleasant glow which reaches here from the many glow worms
below. The balcony is wide and furnished with a few comfortable full length
chairs, which are clearly of gnomish design as they have the ability to
fold into different positions at the touch of a big black button. The royal

    The magnificent reading room has been sectioned off into three distinct

a variety of musical scrolls rest near a plush purple cushion. The next
area is dedicated to card games, apparently the Queen and her husband enjoy
a good game of bridge with the two princes, when time permits. Finally, a
lush sofa and an extensive library indicate the area of the room, which
gives it its name. The royal bedroom lies to the west, while through the
sliding windows to the north the balcony can be reached.

chambers. The doors are well-wrought mithril laced with a spiralling gold
paint, the perfect mix of security and aesthetics. Against the southern
wall hangs a collection of war banners, while a door-sized window on the
northern wall overlooks the beautiful rock garden of Deep Mine. The red

every five meters as the hall extends to form four perpendicular angles.
The floor beneath you is made of smooth, flowing marble. Bright torches

    King Torak has been known to pass judgements based on first
appearances. Apparently Torak had this in mind when he ordered the addition
of this awing entryway to the palace. The entryway consists of a dozen
granite columns lined up on both the left and right hand sides. Columns on
opposite sides are paired together by magnificiently perfect marble arches
that were constructed without a drop of cement to hold them together. The
arches are held together solely by the massive pressure each brick exerts
on the other. Suspended on top of the arches is a domed quartz roof that
casts a bright hue down upon the lavish red carpet that has been rolled out
here. An honor guard post has been set up just south of here to monitor the
entrance of visitors. At the end of the open aired entryway stand large
golden doors leading into the palace. Above the doors a massive seal of the
dwarven kings occupies the remaining space.

Nearly a decade has passed since the original construction of this palace.
King Torak recently invested a heavy chunk of the dwarven treasury towards
a series of upgrades and maintenance projects, resulting in the current
glorious state of the palace. The palace itself has dimensions of a
half-thousand meters squared, and has been constructed in perfect
symmetry. Door sized windows with the curtains drawn line up and down the
dual level, white-washed walls of the palace. Statuettes that depict the
dwarven kings of old stare down at you with pride from atop the roof of the
palace. A majestic entryway greets newcomers to the south with massive
columns of granite crowned by perfect marble arches.

all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.

is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

    Mud puddles line a path, leading directly into the back of a giant

pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below

[36mBefore a Humble Inn[0;37m
    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

[36mJunction One[0;37m
    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

torches above the sign. Many of the villagers walk about here. A group of
merchants mills around, having recently arrived from the main elevator
shaft, which lies directly to the west. To the north and south the Main Way
continues. The Deep Mine Main Shaft is the clear way back to the mountain
surface.

    A clear junction spot of the Main Way, the area is labeled with a huge
sign reading only the number three. Huge tread marks in the ground lead to
the north and west, clearly paths for mining carts along the Main Way.
Surprisingly, the tunnel east, while plenty big enough for the carts, has
no tracks leading in that direction. Villagers are plentiful in the area of
this junction, some chatting wildly with each other, while others sit on
the benches, which have been erected around the junction sign. Torches
bring an abundance of light to this underground tunnel.

    At the top of the stairs from the inn's lobby is a small room serving
as a room registry. Belle sits behind a pine counter, quietly reading,
until a customer arrives. Behind her is a long rack of wooden cubbyholes
and hooks holding room keys. Long halls with many closed doors stretch to
either side. It's quiet and well-kept here, conducive to a good night's
sleep.

    The low ceiling holds the smoke and noise close to the floor in this
busy inn. A dozen long tables stand scattered about the room and a narrow
stair in the back leads to the upper floor. Along the south wall, a
fieldstone hearth holds a rotating spit. Several groups of adventurers are
clustered about the various tables, each eying the others suspiciously and
planning their campaigns in muted tones.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

[36mA Small Chapel[0;37m
    The chapel is dedicated to the god Gilean. Stone walls reach high to
the arched ceiling. Several rows of plain wooden pews have been neatly
arranged facing a simple altar beneath the apse. On top of the altar sits a
scale of balance resting on an open book. The entryway to the south leads
to an antechamber.

[36mAn Unadorned Antechamber[0;37m
    This dimly lit and unadorned chamber acts as the entryway to a simple
chapel to the north. The chamber is scarce of anything, save but a few
torches in wall sconces which do not provide enough light. Some dust and
debris has collected in the corners of the room which suggests it is not
regularly looked after. The sturdy stone walls of this chamber are nearly
unmarred except for a few striations slightly visible in the shadows of
torchlight.

withstood the test of time very well, though how long it has been here is
hard to say. The winding stairs continue up to a small metal hatch above,
and descends to the west.

    Rows of bookshelves lead in all directions, with some shelves far out
of reach. The lower shelves within reach appear to be stacked with hundreds
of books. The bookshelves swallow the surrounding light, making it
difficult to make out any titles without searching the shelves more
closely. The Aesthetics have put considerable work into cleaning this space
and organizing the bookshelves.

    HUMA DRAGONBANE

    Born Huma of Eldor, was born the son of Durac, a Knight of Solamnia,
    and Karina. He had one other known relative named Rennard who was his
    father's brother. Huma never knew his father, because Durac was killed
    one year after becoming a full Knight, while protecting a pass from
    Hylo that would have flanked the Knights. Lord Oswal of Baxtrey took
    Huma under his wing, and told Huma he had always viewed him as a son.
    Huma, when he was grown, was known to be handsome, with weathered
    features, slight gray in his mustache and blonde hair, a soft visage,
    and large in size. He was also known to have worn a suit of full plate
    mail called the Plate of Solamnus. While growing up, Huma had only one
    true friend, Magius. While Magius wanted to become a great War Wizard,
    Huma's mother wanted Huma to claim his birthright as a Knight of
    Solamnia. Upon becoming a knight, Huma had his first few tastes of
    battle where he rescued Kaz the minotaur from a goblin camp, and then
    met his companion and partner the silver dragon, Heart.

    THREE TESTS

    Heart appeared before Huma in the form of a beautiful half-elf named
    Gwyneth and informed Huma that he may be the one who symbolized
    Paladine's teachings. Gwyneth asked that Huma pass Paladine's three
    "tests", one for each of the Solamnic Triumvirate. His first test was
    the great Wyrmfather. After initially running from Wyrmfather, Huma
    found a green sword call the Sword of Tears, which he used to kill
    Wyrmfather when the dragon tried to eat him. He then found a great
    mirror in Wyrmfather's treasure and vanished into it, only to appear in
    Vingaard Keep. His next test in Vingaard Keep involved his uncle
    Rennard. Huma found out that his uncle was the one behind the death of
    the Grand Master Trake of Baxtrey, and was able to chase him from the
    keep. When Huma returned to find the Sword of Tears, Rennard confronted
    him. Huma defeated Rennard, and discovered that Rennard was really his
    uncle. Huma granted his uncle mercy and a chance to redeem himself, but
    Rennard succumbed to the scarlet plague. Upon returning to the cave
    where he defeated Wyrmfather, Huma picked up the powerful Sword of
    Tears. Huma was then confronted by the Gray Man who asked him to leave
    the evil sword behind. After an internal battle with himself, Huma
    dropped the sword and it vanished. This was the last of Huma's three
    tests.

    THE DRAGONLANCE & TAKHISIS

    After passing his tests, Gwyneth took him to receive the weapon he had
    been searching for. There he met the creator, Duncan Ironweaver, and
    was given the Knights salvation in a weapon called the Dragonlance.
    With the dragonlances in hand Huma and a band of twenty dragon riders
    protected Vingaard Keep from an assault from Takhisis and her chromatic
    dragons. In the final battle, Heart and Huma were the only ones able to
    attack the evil goddess Takhisis' aspect. Together, Huma and Heart
    charged in and pierced the blue head on the goddess' mammoth body
    making her feel pain for the first time, but this cost them both. Heart
    was struck a violent blow that sent both her and Huma tumbling. Heart
    was able to make a landing that would save Huma, but she would pay
    dearly for it. Huma confessed his love for the dragon Heart as she
    succumbed to her injuries sustained in her battle with Takhisis. Huma
    then confronted the struggling goddess who was thrashing around
    attempting to remove the Dragonlance. When Huma arrived overlooking
    her, Takhisis' green head blasted him with gas and he fell, breaking
    many bones and sustaining a life ending injury. Before he died, Huma
    made Takhisis promise to leave Krynn along with all her dragons, which
    she agreed to. With his last breaths Huma asked Kaz to pull the
    Dragonlance from Takhisis' body. Huma died shortly after seeing his
    last deed done, while holding his amulet of Paladine, and thinking of
    his beloved Heart.

    THE FIRST MAGES

    Wild magic, or elemental magic, has always existed on Krynn. The coming
    of the Grey Gem, however, loosed what could be considered "modern"
    sorcerous powers into the world. The Grey Gem came to Krynn through the
    actions of the Smiths, the antecedents of modern Dwarves. The arrival
    of the Grey Gem resulted in the creation of the Scions. Beings
    saturated and infused with magic. The Scions eventually went on to
    tutor the first mages. This order of first mages then began to search
    across Ansalon for locations where towers, bastions, could be built to
    study, control and stabilize magic. The gods of magic, Solinari of
    white magic, Lunitari of red magic, and Nuitari of black magic, would
    eventually arrive upon Krynn and effect the creation of the 3 orders of
    magic, the White, Black, and Red robes, further structuring the
    development of sorcerous magic.

    RAISING THE TOWERS

    The Towers of High Sorcery would be raised in different parts of Krynn
    according to selection of sites deemed appropriate through the use of
    divination stones. Thus, the different towers were created. As a
    protection measure, each was surrounded by a magical forest that would
    stop any non-mage from nearing. These forest were named the Guardian
    Forest of the Tower, and each one had a different effect. The first
    Towers of High Sorcery were created between the years 2645 and 2550 PC
    approximately. There were 5 raised. A 6th was intended, but the Dwarves
    of the just-founded Thorbardin took issue with wizards setting up shop
    on their mountains. A small war followed, the dwarves won, and the site
    was abandoned.

    THE FIVE

    Through time, five towers were created, each situated in studied
    strategical points where the most powerful magical forces lay. The
    Tower of High Sorcery of Daltigoth was located in Daltigoth, capital of
    the empire of Ergoth. The mages destroyed the Tower and a quarter of
    Daltigoth with it. The Tower of High Sorcery of Losarcum was built
    south of the fertile fields of Istar near the homeland of the kenders.
    It was the second Tower to be destroyed. The mages destroyed it and the
    city of Losarcum completely at the same time. The Tower of High Sorcery
    of Istar was built in the prosperous city of Istar long before the
    coming of the Kingpriest and the persecution of the mages. After the
    Orders surrendered the Tower, Beldinas Pilofiro made it a private
    storeroom where he put the different elements the Divine Hammer
    confiscated from their raids. The Tower of High Sorcery of Istar was
    almost destroyed in the Cataclysm, along with the city itself. Situated
    near the centre of Palanthas, in front of what would later become the
    Temple of Paladine, the Tower of High Sorcery of Palanthas was the most
    beautiful building in the city, a tower made of pure white marble
    surrounded by fences of gold. However, at the end of the Lost Wars, and
    while the Master of the Tower was surrendering it to the local
    authorities, a black wizard named Rannoch, rendered insane from the
    attack on his beloved magic, sacrificed himself to curse it. Tower of
    High Sorcery of Wayreth is situated in the Forest of Wayreth, near the
    Qualinesti border: the only tower to have survived the Fourth Age,
    undamaged.

    HUMBLE BEGINNINGS

    The Holy Empire of Istar was one of the greatest empires on all of
    Krynn. At the height of its power Istar spanned from the eastern
    borders of Thoradin and Taman Busuk in the west, Silvanesti and Balifor
    to the south, and the Courrain Ocean to the east and north. The lands
    varied from deserts in the south, hills and forests in the west, open
    grasslands to the northwest and central, and jungle to the east and
    northeast. First the Kings of Istar, then the Emperor of Istar led the
    nation for many years, before the Kingpriests of Istar came to power.
    The Imperial sign is the falcon. Istar began as a humble and peaceful
    fishing village founded around 2500 PC. Asanta, Head of the White
    Robes, came to Istar seeking a new location for a Tower of High
    Sorcery. Asanta had a vision, that one day this small village would be
    a great metropolis, and the center of good on Ansalon with the
    assistance of the mages. The tower was built, and gave the people great
    visions of grandeur. The Istarians rid themselves of their beliefs of
    ancestor-worship and began the worship of the Gods of Light,
    particularly Paladine, Mishakal, and Solinari.

    THE HOLY SEE

    During the Third Dragon War the horsemen of Dravinaar attacked Istar
    and razed half of the Lordcity. The people of Istar called to the
    wizards for assistance, but they were away and could not assist, So
    they turned to the church. The head of the church of Paladine called
    forth a cleansing flame that put fear into the hearts of the Dravinish,
    while boosting the morale of the Istarans. The Istarans pushed out the
    horsemen, and won a great victory. The people of Istar would forever
    hold this against the wizards which granted the clerics significant
    political clout in the Lordcity of Istar. Following the Third Dragon
    War, Istar grew in power and commerce in the east. A warrior named Lord
    Galeric named himself the first King of Istar in 962 PC, and formed the
    Kingdom of Istar. Istar continued to have an Kings, and eventually
    Emperors as their leader until 280 PC. Emperor Vemior was overthrown
    from power by Symeon I, and Symeon declared that Istar was the moral
    center of the world and took the title of Kingpriest and renamed the
    Empire of Istar the Holy Empire of Istar.

    BELDINAS AND THE CATACLYSM

    The final Kingpriest, Beldinas, came to power in 40 PC. Beldinas
    organized the Order of the Divine Hammer, which destroyed both Evil and
    Neutral churches. Slavery was reinstated in 15 PC for the Empire, and
    in 6 PC the Edict of Thought Control was instituted. In the days
    leading up the Cataclysm, Istar and Ansalon received Thirteen Warnings
    from the gods. These warnings arrived in the form of different
    calamities, but the people presumed that it was the gods of evil
    attempting to destroy Ansalon. The citizens of Istar trusted the
    Kingpriest to protect them from the gods, and he attempted to. Beldinas
    made his demand to become a god, and the gods hurled the fiery mountain
    down upon the city of Istar, causing an impact now known as the
    Cataclysm. Not only did the mountain sink the city, it destroyed much
    of the surrounding lands, and eventually formed the Blood Sea of Istar.
    Almost all of Istar Province and the eastern provinces sank beneath the
    waves, while some of the lands became part of Khur, Kern, Goodlund, the
    Isle of Karthay, Saifhum, and the Minotaur Empire.

[36mAmidst the Remains of Broken Bookshelves[0;37m
    This section of bookshelves has been partially crushed and destroyed,
and the scattered debris from the broken shelves makes it very difficult to
walk around this area. Several books from the shelves lie scattered across
the floor, with many of their pages torn from their bindings. It is still
possible to access some of the books on the upper and lower shelves to the
north and south, as these shelves are only partially destroyed. Before
their collapse this row of bookshelves would have continued to the east,
but now the path is completely impassable. The only remaining exit is to
the west.

    It would take a keen eye to find a speck of dust among these
bookshelves after the hard work of the Aesthetics. There are four
bookshelves in this row, two lower and two upper. The shelves appear to go
on forever, housing hundreds of books. Far above the highest shelves the
ceiling appears to have wide skylights which have been covered with earth
and rock. There is an eerie silence about this place, and each footstep
echoes almost eternally.

    Rows upon rows of bookshelves sprawl out in every direction. A wide

bookshelves on the floor below. Every square inch of the walls are covered
in bookshelves, upon which lie thousands of ancient tomes. Rival to the
Great Library of Palanthas, this library was once thought to have been lost
in the Cataclysm. There is no telling what secrets and wonders lie within
the pages of the books here.

    THE DOME OF CREATION AND THE WHITE MOON

    The Gods of Good believe that teaching mortals to love order and law is
    the way to preserve the Balance. Their combined doctrine is
    encouragement, nurturing, and love. They defend the world and mortals
    from evil, but usually this is done by influencing mortals rather than
    directly intervening in mortal affairs. The Gods of Good, led by
    Paladine, reside in the Dome of Creation, a plane of light and positive
    energy. The plane houses the essences of all the Gods of Good except
    Solinari, who remains closer to the world in his white moon. Solinari,
    also known as the Mighty Hand, the Ivory Disk, and God's Eye,
    represents the godly power of magic used for good. He patrons wizards
    who use their magic with the ideals of compassion, protection, and
    foresight. As one of the creators of the Laws of High Sorcery he
    upholds them vigorously.

    THE FIRST MAGES

    Wild magic, or elemental magic, has always existed on Krynn. The coming
    of the Grey Gem, however, loosed what could be considered "modern"
    sorcerous powers into the world. The Grey Gem came to Krynn through the
    actions of the Smiths, the antecedents of modern Dwarves. The arrival
    of the Grey Gem resulted in the creation of the Scions. Beings
    saturated and infused with magic. The Scions eventually went on to
    tutor the first mages. This order of first mages then began to search
    across Ansalon for locations where towers, bastions, could be built to
    study, control and stabilize magic. The gods of magic, Solinari of
    white magic, Lunitari of red magic, and Nuitari of black magic, would
    eventually arrive upon Krynn and effect the creation of the 3 orders of
    magic, the White, Black, and Red robes, further structuring the
    development of sorcerous magic.

Bakukal, the 8th day of Brookgreen, 321

By the wisdom of Gilean I have been tasked with rebuilding the Great
Library, but Bertrem has granted us limited resources. What is worse that
fool has placed a young woman with little experience in charge, Lillith
Hallmark. Bertram and Lillith feel that my newfound title of "Head
Chronicler" would somehow forgive their vast incompetence, yet I continue
to be the only chronicler on staff.

I will admit, Lillith relinquished the head librarian office and quarters
to me, as she spends the nights awake reading endlessly. At times I suspect
Lillith is dabbling in the arcane. I should be sure to keep all texts of
arcane influence in my quarters, so that the sorceress cannot peruse them.

place to focus on their studies. This area is well lit by a chandelier
hanging from the alcove ceiling casting shadows out onto the balcony. A

balcony encircles the upper region of the library and the rows of
bookshelves on the floor below. Every square inch of the walls are covered
in bookshelves, upon which lie thousands of ancient tomes. Rival to the
Great Library of Palanthas, this library was once thought to have been lost
in the Cataclysm. There is no telling what secrets and wonders lie within
the pages of the books here.

    A stark contrast to the nearby rows, the bookshelves here have been
reduced to a large pile of rubble blocking passage in some directions. The
shelves that are still visible are broken and covered in dust, with many
books lost to the ages. Far above the bookshelf remnants there are wide
skylights that are dark and barely visible, offering no additional light.
The Aesthetics speak of this section with deep sadness, lamenting the
knowledge lost. It is difficult to move without stepping on rocks and
debris and to continue on the path north or east would be impossible.

of books. The bookshelves swallow the surrounding light, making it
difficult to make out any titles without searching the shelves more
closely. The Aesthetics have put considerable work into cleaning this space
and organizing the bookshelves.

    This row of bookshelves appears to have previously run from west to
east, but all of the bookshelves along the north wall of the library have
been been completely crushed under what looks like a fallen slab of stone
from the balcony above. Not surprisingly the bookshelves along this row
have all been destroyed, and broken remnants of the ancient vallenwood
shelves litter the floor. The path to the west is completely impassable due
to the clutter of collapsed shelves and stone debris. To the east the
remains of the fallen slab lay upon the shattered shelves. There is a
significant amount of rubble and debris scattered about the area.

    This section of bookshelves has been partially crushed and destroyed,
and the scattered debris from the broken shelves makes it very difficult to
walk around this area. Several books from the shelves lie scattered across
the floor, with many of their pages torn from their bindings. It is still
possible to access some of the books on the upper and lower shelves to the
north and south, as these shelves are only partially destroyed. Before
their collapse this row of bookshelves would have continued to the east,
but now the path is completely impassable. The only remaining exit is to
the west.

    A stark contrast to the nearby rows, the bookshelves here have been
reduced to a large pile of rubble blocking passage in some directions. The
shelves that are still visible are broken and covered in dust, with many
books lost to the ages. Far above the bookshelf remnants there are wide
skylights that are dark and barely visible, offering no additional light.
The Aesthetics speak of this section with deep sadness, lamenting the
knowledge lost. It is difficult to move without stepping on rocks and
debris and to continue on the path north or east would be impossible.

    This simple but elegant hallway reaches a corner here, with a pathway
continuing to the north and west. The hall here is well lit by round
glowing orbs which rest atop silver wall sconces and shine light to every
corner and crevice. It's difficult to discern the material of the sheer
white walls to the south and east, but unlike the rest of this aging

the south, and a much larger heavy wood door in the wall to the east with a
small but inviting rug at the foot of the door.

    The road becomes very dry and cracked, making travel difficult and
conditions tiresome. Occasional shrub plants are the only source of
vegetation in the area, although this meager supply is enough to feed
several varieties of bird life. The road continues to the south, while to
the north it reaches a bend. To the east, you see the vast Plains of Dust.
To the west, a dry, dead forest opens up.

[36mA Bend in the Road[0;37m
    Here, there is a sharp turn in the road. To the west, it heads into
some kind of a large, wooded area, teeming with life. To the south, it
enters a large, dry plain, with a few hills, and sparse vegetation. To the
east you see nothing but endless desert -- the dreaded Plains of Dust. You
can hear the screeching of some large birds which fly overhead, and, with a
shudder, you continue.

[36mA Small Side Street[0;37m
    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace dominates
one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill the
room. A stairway leads up, further into the tree, while another stairway
leads down to the forest below.
