     The first thing you notice is the large tracks in the white dust below
your feet. Whereas the rest of the dust in the temple seems to settle as
soon as people pass through it, the dust here has obviously been disturbed
too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high
traffic area, though there is no way to tell why from here. There is a
large yellow crystal door to the west, one of only a few in the Temple.

     This room, like its three companions, is spartan to the point of
bareness. The walls are plain and undecorated, the floor is covered with a
fine layer of dirt to serve as a carpet of sorts, and there are only two
torches in the room to illuminate it. The wooden furniture looks almost as
thought it is about to fall apart, which doesn't really surprise you. As

     Chiseled directly into the white marble walls here are a series of
shelves, all of them filled with ancient scrolls. There are at least a
dozen shelves in each wall, save the one to the east. As you reach toward
one of the scrolls, a slight buzzing starts in the back of your mind and
you see a magical shield snap into place. Glancing around the room, you see
the same bluish shield protecting all the shelves save one.

     Unlike the Gargoyles in the earlier chamber, these Gargoyles have
rudimentary weapons and crude armor, but both look awkward on the
creatures. It is readily apparent that they are just learning how to use
the new pieces of equipment. On a whim you look down and see three women,
one in a red robe, one in a black robe, and one in a white robe. They
appear to be in near orgasmic delight over whatever plan it is they are
weaving.

     Chiseled into the walls here are scenes of monsters, which can only be
the Gargoyles, but these aren't like any Gargoyles you've heard of in the
past. These creatures actually look like they are at peace. In various
images from the walls you realize that these Gargoyles lived in a village
somewhere in a forest. They seem to be hunting and even farming, but you
can see no traces of weapons or armor. In the distance you see three
figures, each wearing a different colored robe.

     The first thing you notice, and most magnificent item in this room, is
a large oak tree taking up the entire north wall. There is no sign of how
sunlight and water get to the tree, yet it still stands before you
majestically. To the right and left of the tree are two small shrines, both
covered with magenta clothes. The floor beneath your feet is completely
bare of the white dust you've seen everywhere else in the Temple. To the
east you feel a holy presence, as if from a chapel.

     You find yourself at a crossroads in an otherwise nondescript room.
There are no signs telling you what is in each direction, but you
immediately pick up some signs. The dust on the floor to the east seems to
be well passed on. To the south you can see the flicker of a torch set in
the wall. The passage to the west looks like more of the same undecorated
stone as you are currently surrounded by. To the north there is what
appears to be a tree.

     The first thing you notice is the large tracks in the white dust below
your feet. Whereas the rest of the dust in the temple seems to settle as
soon as people pass through it, the dust here has obviously been disturbed
too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high
traffic area, though there is no way to tell why from here. There is a
large granite door to the east, one of only a few in the Temple.

[36mGuardian Chamber[0;37m
     This room, like its three companions, is spartan to the point of
bareness. The walls are plain and undecorated, the floor is covered with a
fine layer of dirt to serve as a carpet of sorts, and there are only two
torches in the room to illuminate it. The wooden furniture looks almost as
though it is about to fall apart, which doesn't really surprise you. As
you turn to leave, you notice a mountainous landscape chiseled above the
door.

the coming of the Celestial War. It is almost as if this room serves as the
visual history of the temple. You notice that there is very little space
for any additional events to be chiseled, meaning either the prophets
expect little else to happen or the temple is nearing the end of its
existence. If it is the latter, you can't help but feel that a great

is the same marble of the walls. On the east wall is the figure of an
Aurinite holding a basket of herbs. On the west wall is a gargoyle, its
claws clutching a small child. It occurs to you for the first time that

     This room, like its three companions, is spartan to the point of
bareness. The walls are plain and undecorated, the floor is covered with a
fine layer of dirt to serve as a carpet of sorts, and there are only two
torches in the room to illuminate it. The wooden furniture looks almost as
thought it is about to fall apart, which doesn't really surprise you. As
you turn to leave, you notice a large flaming sun chiseled above the door.

of red crystal and dark stone that streak through them. As you trace the
lines of crystal and stone along the wall, you notice that they appear to

impossible to tell how far to the north it is due to the echoes in the

     The walls of the Temple are made from solid white marble here, a
remarkable contrast to the drab brown stone that makes up the exterior of
the temple. The floor is layered with a thin white dust, which you suspect
is the same marble of the walls. On the east wall is the figure of an
Aurinite holding a basket of herbs. On the west wall is a gargoyle, its
claws clutching a small child. It occurs to you for the first time that

     The white marble walls of this room are intricately covered with runes
and carvings displaying everything from the construction of the temple to
the coming of the Celestial War. It is almost as if this room serves as the
visual history of the temple. You notice that there is very little space
for any additional events to be chiseled, meaning either the prophets
expect little else to happen or the temple is nearing the end of its
existence. If it is the latter, you can't help but feel that a great

     You find yourself at a crossroads in an otherwise nondescript room.
There are no signs telling you what is in each direction, but you
immediately pick up some signs. The dust on the floor to the east seems to
be well passed on. To the south you can see the flicker of a torch set in
the wall. The passage to the west looks like more of the same undecorated
stone as you are currently surrounded by. To the north there is what
appears to be a tree.

barren. The walls, floor, and ceiling are a dark brown in color with veins
of green streaming through them. The altar at the far end of the room is
made from a dirty grey stone, its surface covered with specks of black and

each made from what looks like solidified mud. The only decoration in the

barren. The walls, floor, and ceiling are a dark brown in color with veins
of green streaming through them. The altar at the far end of the room is
made from a dirty grey stone, its surface covered with specks of black and

each made from what looks like solidified mud. The only decoration in the

your feet. Whereas the rest of the dust in the temple seems to settle as
soon as people pass through it, the dust here has obviously been disturbed
too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high
traffic area, though there is no way to tell why from here. There is a
large granite door to the east, one of only a few in the Temple.

darkness and black marble walls. To the north is a light from a flickering
torch and nearly transparent crystal walls. The north is also considerably
warmer than the east. The two powers seem to meet in the middle of the room
and cancel each other out in a nearly straight line. Halfway up the wall,
split by the powers of light and dark, is the figure of an owl holding a
sacred sword.

     The darkness here is unsettling to say the least. You can almost feel
it soaking into your soul and trying to possess everything that you are. In
the flicker of your light you can see nothing but black walls. There are no
decorations, no carvings, nothing to break the disheartening blackness of
this room. The abyss-like darkness continues unabated to the west but stops
immediately to the south as though it can't progress in that direction.

     Before you can even look around the room, you feel a shiver run
through your system. It doesn't take long to realize it is the area to the
north that is causing your discomfort. Despite your best efforts, you can't
penetrate the total blackness that sits there like a waiting demon.
Suppressing another shiver, you look around the room. This section of the
Temple is completely nondescript, almost as if people were too scared to
spend much time here.

There are no signs telling you what is in each direction, but you
immediately pick up some signs. The dust on the floor to the east seems to

soon as people pass through it, the dust here has obviously been disturbed
too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high

     Set into the west wall here is a flickering torch made from an almost
black wood. But that isn't what draws your attention, especially since the
remainder of this room is basically spartan. Hanging in the air foot above
your head are three arrows, one pointing towards each of the three exits.
The east arrow has the word "Legends" written on it. The north arrow has
the word "Land." The south arrow has the word "Portal." Obviously this is
an important crossroad in the Temple.

     Before you can even look around the room, you feel a shiver run
through your system. It doesn't take long to realize it is the area to the
north that is causing your discomfort. Despite your best efforts, you can't
penetrate the total blackness that sits there like a waiting demon.
Suppressing another shiver, you look around the room. This section of the

     An odd silence overtakes the Temple here. There are no sounds of
movement, no scrapings of metal, and no voices in the distance. It's almost
as though this room is immune to the affairs of the Temple and the war
raging on the floors above. The walls here are also completely plain, the
dust on the floor undisturbed by time or even your footsteps. For some
reason, this room has remained completely pristine.

     The carvings here seem to be more scrawlings that anything else,
almost as if a child had done them. High on the wall, higher than any child
could reach, is the barren Celestial Valley before the Temple was built on
it. Below that is a race of dwarf-like creatures carrying equipment into
the valley. Near the bottom is the half finished Temple. It occurs to you
that the large Temple drawn here is considerably larger than what you can
see of the Temple outside, almost as if the valley is trying to reclaim its
lost lands.

looks like the arrival of the two armies to the Temple. Near the top are
the two kings engaged in battle. Below them are the two armies engaged in
the deadliest of combat. There looks to have been something below that, but
it has since been lost to the sands of time.

Celestial War before the druid trapped them within the Temple walls.
Standing at the top of the wall wrapped in strands of silver energy is the
druid caught in his final spell. Below him are the two armies, each
surrounded by swirls of gold and silver. At the bottom of the wall is the
Celestial Valley slowly recovering from the war that raged across it.

with various toys, some resembling Aurinites while others resemble
Gargoyles. The walls have been smeared by what appear to be paints and

     Before you stands a Celestial Gate, though this one is considerably
smaller than the ones you saw in the valley earlier. It is also carved
directly into the east wall instead of standing alone. The room itself is
decorated with a variety of runes. Though you can't understand the language
in which they are chiseled, you feel they are direction on how to use the
gate. Besides the gate and carvings, there is little else in this room to
draw your attention.

     This area looks like a children's' play area. The floor is scattered
with various toys, some resembling Aurinites while others resemble
Gargoyles. The walls have been smeared by what appear to be paints and
dyes, probably in some attempt to decorate the place. As you study the
room, you realize that a mock battle is being played out here between the
two forces.  In the center of the room is a small sword, probably meant to
represent Caliburn, the sword of sacred fires.

Whereas the majority of the Temple corridors are subdued in color, here it
looks as though a rainbow exploded. As you walk up to one of the walls and
run your finger along the marble, the color comes off onto your finger. The
more you study the walls, the more it looks as though a collection of
children did this instead of being natural to the Temple. You hear laughter

     The north, east and west walls are lined with heavy oaken cabinet,
each with a sturdy glass door. Without even checking, you know the doors to
the cabinets are locked, probably magically. In the center of the room is a
single table and two chairs, all made from the same oak as the cabinets.
The floor of the room is covered with a fine white dust, though you can't
tell what it's composed of. There are no decorations on the wall or ceiling
or any indication of comfort.

     A scent assaults your nose here, and it is obviously coming from the

text, though there is only one way to be sure. Once you get past the smell,
you notice there are a collection of writings on the walls here, all of
them illegible. You occasionally see glyphs that looks like Fyzians,
Aurinites, and Gargoyles, but little else looks familiar.

     The walls of this room seem to have gone completely insane with color.
Whereas the majority of the Temple corridors are subdued in color, here it
looks as though a rainbow exploded. As you walk up to one of the walls and
run your finger along the marble, the color comes off onto your finger. The
more you study the walls, the more it looks as though a collection of
children did this instead of being natural to the Temple. You hear laughter
to the south and smell something faint in the air to the west.

     This area looks like a children's' play area. The floor is scattered
with various toys, some resembling Aurinites while others resemble
Gargoyles. The walls have been smeared by what appear to be paints and
dyes, probably in some attempt to decorate the place. As you study the
room, you realize that a mock battle is being played out here between the
two forces.  In the center of the room is a small sword, probably meant to
represent Caliburn, the sword of sacred fires.

     This area looks like a children's' play area. The floor is scattered
with various toys, some resembling Aurinites while others resemble
Gargoyles. The walls have been smeared by what appear to be paints and
dyes, probably in some attempt to decorate the place. As you study the
room, you realize that a mock battle is being played out here between the
two forces.  In the center of the room is a small sword, probably meant to
represent Caliburn, the sword of sacred fires.

[36mA Celestial Gate[0;37m
     Before you stands a Celestial Gate, though this one is considerably
smaller than the ones you saw in the valley earlier. It is also carved
directly into the east wall instead of standing alone. The room itself is
decorated with a variety of runes. Though you can't understand the language
in which they are chiseled, you feel they are direction on how to use the
gate. Besides the gate and carvings, there is little else in this room to
draw your attention.

     This area looks like a children's' play area. The floor is scattered
with various toys, some resembling Aurinites while others resemble
Gargoyles. The walls have been smeared by what appear to be paints and
dyes, probably in some attempt to decorate the place. As you study the
room, you realize that a mock battle is being played out here between the
two forces.  In the center of the room is a small sword, probably meant to
represent Caliburn, the sword of sacred fires.

     The walls of this room seem to have gone completely insane with color.
Whereas the majority of the Temple corridors are subdued in color, here it
looks as though a rainbow exploded. As you walk up to one of the walls and
run your finger along the marble, the color comes off onto your finger. The
more you study the walls, the more it looks as though a collection of
children did this instead of being natural to the Temple. You hear laughter
to the south and smell something faint in the air to the west.

Whereas the majority of the Temple corridors are subdued in color, here it

The walls are bare of any decorations save a single symbol below the torch.
Although you cannot tell what language it is, a voice seems to whisper in

darkness and black marble walls. To the north is a light from a flickering
torch and nearly transparent crystal walls. The north is also considerably
warmer than the east. The two powers seem to meet in the middle of the room
and cancel each other out in a nearly straight line. Halfway up the wall,
split by the powers of light and dark, is the figure of an owl holding a
sacred sword.

visual history of the temple. You notice that there is very little space
for any additional events to be chiseled, meaning either the prophets
expect little else to happen or the temple is nearing the end of its
existence. If it is the latter, you can't help but feel that a great

As Sprink slips the key into the Celestial Gate's keyhole, the thin
film blocking you from entering the energy field fades silently away. The
guards standing on either side of the gate bow their heads and stand a
little more rigid, but they make no move to stop you from entering.

located at the center of the Celestial Temple. The Gate takes up the center
of the room, a mixture of the light and dark power swirling within its
crystal and granite frame. The walls to the north and east of this chamber
are composed of the same crystal material, while the walls to the south and
west are made of granite. A collection of inscriptions and markings wrap
around the room just above the doorways. On the ceiling above is a mosaic
of an ancient sword wrapped in tongues of fire. Most of the room is taken
up by the Celestial Gate.

of the room, a mixture of the light and dark power swirling within its
crystal and granite frame. The walls to the north and east of this chamber
are composed of the same crystal material, while the walls to the south and
west are made of granite. A collection of inscriptions and markings wrap
around the room just above the doorways. On the ceiling above is a mosaic
of an ancient sword wrapped in tongues of fire. Most of the room is taken
up by the Celestial Gate.

     You find yourself at a crossroads of sorts. The area to the east and
south is composed of ivory and has an air of purity and goodness around it.
In sharp contrast to that, the area to the west looks to be granite covered
with vines. You get a sense of deep foreboding from that area, almost as
though death himself had visited it and blessed it. To the north you can
feel the remarkable energy of the Celestial Gate emanating toward you.

get the impression that a battle of untold proportions was fought in this

The walls, floor, and ceiling are marred with burn marks, weapon slashes,
and the dried blood of both armies. You can also see the remains of

located at the center of the Celestial Temple. The Gate takes up the center

are composed of the same crystal material, while the walls to the south and
west are made of granite. A collection of inscriptions and markings wrap
around the room just above the doorways. On the ceiling above is a mosaic
of an ancient sword wrapped in tongues of fire. Most of the room is taken

     As you enter this section of the Celestial Temple, you get the
distinct impression that the two armies fought violently to control this
area. There are both burn and weapon marks all along the wall, marring what
was most likely a pristine and holy surface. The floor is littered with
pieces of granite and crystal. Although you can see both types of material
used in the Temple walls, you doubt that these pieces of rubble came from
the walls. They seem almost alive, or were possible alive once.

located at the center of the Celestial Temple. The Gate takes up the center
of the room, a mixture of the light and dark power swirling within its
crystal and granite frame. The walls to the north and east of this chamber
are composed of the same crystal material, while the walls to the south and
west are made of granite. A collection of inscriptions and markings wrap
around the room just above the doorways. On the ceiling above is a mosaic
of an ancient sword wrapped in tongues of fire. Most of the room is taken

     As you enter this section of the Celestial Temple, you get the
distinct impression that the two armies fought violently to control this
area. There are both burn and weapon marks all along the wall, marring what
was most likely a pristine and holy surface. The floor is littered with
pieces of granite and crystal. Although you can see both types of material
used in the Temple walls, you doubt that these pieces of rubble came from
the walls. They seem almost alive, or were possible alive once.

sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring

marks of a wagon in the dirt spots of the road, left by the increasing
number of merchants travelling between Newport and the towns of Solace and
Haven. Around you the landscape is dotted with trees and the area is hilly.
In the air you can faintly smell salt, carried by a breeze blowing from the
northeast. The road leads to the north and east from here. Southeast you can
hear the sounds of a bustling town and to the north you hear a low rumbling.

it crashes into the pillars and is forced around them. The stone bridge
stretches northward, high above the river, but the southern bank is still

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
