to the north into the foothills, and to the west out of the badlands.
Branching off to the east you can also make out a smaller path which bends
quickly to the north and out of your sight.

    The path through the badlands curves out around the base of the
Khalkists. The mountains rise to the east, towering over the foothills in a
cruelly jagged reign. The foothills spread out to the north and west,
covering the rugged terrain of northern Taman Busuk. The path runs east
along the sides of the mountains and down towards the lower foothills to
the south.

[36mThe Dusty Training Grounds[0;37m
    Thick dust covers the floor of the training grounds which swirls
through the air when it is kicked up by dragonarmy recruits honing their
combat skills. Wooden training dummies crafted to loosely resemble a
humanoid figure are scattered through the area, covered with large notches
and gouges where metal weapons have bit deep into their timber. Marring the
dust covered ground are a few splashes of crimson, most likely dried blood
that was spilt during heated sparring sessions. The dusty training grounds
continues to extend outwards to the east and south, while the other
directions lead to quieter areas of the camp.

[36mBefore a Large Building[0;37m
    Grey dirt has been heavily compacted here to form a sandy path that
leads from the dusty training grounds where the recruits hone their battle
skills to a large stone building directly north of here. Tall banners of
pitch black cloth hang over the walls of the building emblazoned with the
snow white insignia of the White Dragonarmy. The stone building is well
constructed and made from thick stone, having been clearly designed as a
well fortified structure that can be used as a defensive position should
the training camp come under siege. Clouds of dust are occasionally blown
through the area, carried in from the dusty training grounds to the east by
gusts of wind that ebb and flow.

    Although structurally well built, this entrance hall lacks any finesse
or fashion. The walls are completely bare stone, there is no furniture
within eyeshot and the floor has been made of plain oaken floorboards. The
White Dragonarmy's leadership is obviously more concerned with devoting
their resources to their war effort rather than luxury. Corridors to the
north and east lead to other areas of the officers' mess, whilst a pair of
thick ironwood doors are fixed in the western wall.

[36mThe Captain's Quarters[0;37m
    The furnishings of this room are lavish by comparison to the rest of
the officer's mess, though saying the room is luxurious would be far from
the truth. Large maps of Solamnia, Palanthas and Vingaard are spread across
the stone walls of the chamber which have numerous small pins placed in
them, presumably marking specific strategic locations. Set up in the
western half of the room is a massive desk of solid ironwood complete with
a wooden chair where the leader of this camp presumably completes any
administrative work that is required, though the build up of paperwork
suggest those duties are often neglected. Two small green potted plants
rest in the corners of the room which provide some colour and vibrancy to
the room, breathing a wisp of life into the otherwise dull environment.

Scaly skin of glimmering silver covers the body of this hulking sivak
draconian who looms tall at a monstrous ten feet high. The large, bulging
muscles that cover his limbs leave no question that he possesses massive
strength, yet his movements are swift and graceful with an agility that is
slightly unexpected of such a hulking creature. A decorative breastplate
that is adorned with the markings of high rank hangs over his body, openly
displaying his esteemed position in the Dark Queen's armies and marking him
as the commander of this camp.
Captain Vakarr is in an excellent condition.

    Although structurally well built, this entrance hall lacks any finesse
or fashion. The walls are completely bare stone, there is no furniture
within eyeshot and the floor has been made of plain oaken floorboards. The
White Dragonarmy's leadership is obviously more concerned with devoting
their resources to their war effort rather than luxury. Corridors to the
north and east lead to other areas of the officers' mess, whilst a pair of
thick ironwood doors are fixed in the western wall.

[36mThe Captain's Quarters[0;37m
    The furnishings of this room are lavish by comparison to the rest of
the officer's mess, though saying the room is luxurious would be far from
the truth. Large maps of Solamnia, Palanthas and Vingaard are spread across
the stone walls of the chamber which have numerous small pins placed in
them, presumably marking specific strategic locations. Set up in the
western half of the room is a massive desk of solid ironwood complete with
a wooden chair where the leader of this camp presumably completes any
administrative work that is required, though the build up of paperwork
suggest those duties are often neglected. Two small green potted plants
rest in the corners of the room which provide some colour and vibrancy to
the room, breathing a wisp of life into the otherwise dull environment.

pitch black cloth hang over the walls of the building emblazoned with the
snow white insignia of the White Dragonarmy. The stone building is well
constructed and made from thick stone, having been clearly designed as a
well fortified structure that can be used as a defensive position should
the training camp come under siege. Clouds of dust are occasionally blown
through the area, carried in from the dusty training grounds to the east by

humanoid figure are scattered through the area, covered with large notches
and gouges where metal weapons have bit deep into their timber. Marring the

[36mOn a Small Stone Path[0;37m
    Dozens of flat black stones have been laid into the dusty ground here,
creating a makeshift stone path which connects the building to the north
with the main training grounds. Large bushes of thick green foliage grow on
either side of the pathway which seem to dampen the noise coming from the
training ground, making this area quieter than the rest of the camp. Dusty
footprints lead to and from the stone building that stands directly to the
north, as though whomever resides there has regular visitors.

[36mThe Dusty Training Grounds[0;37m
    Thick dust covers the floor of the training grounds which swirls
through the air when it is kicked up by dragonarmy recruits honing their
combat skills. Wooden training dummies crafted to loosely resemble a
humanoid figure are scattered through the area, covered with large notches
and gouges where metal weapons have bit deep into their timber. Marring the
dust covered ground are a few splashes of crimson, most likely dried blood
that was spilt during heated sparring sessions. The dusty training grounds
continues to extend outwards to the east and south, while the other
directions lead to quieter areas of the camp.

[36mBefore a Large Building[0;37m
    Grey dirt has been heavily compacted here to form a sandy path that
leads from the dusty training grounds where the recruits hone their battle
skills to a large stone building directly north of here. Tall banners of
pitch black cloth hang over the walls of the building emblazoned with the
snow white insignia of the White Dragonarmy. The stone building is well
constructed and made from thick stone, having been clearly designed as a
well fortified structure that can be used as a defensive position should
the training camp come under siege. Clouds of dust are occasionally blown
through the area, carried in from the dusty training grounds to the east by
gusts of wind that ebb and flow.

    Although structurally well built, this entrance hall lacks any finesse
or fashion. The walls are completely bare stone, there is no furniture
within eyeshot and the floor has been made of plain oaken floorboards. The
White Dragonarmy's leadership is obviously more concerned with devoting
their resources to their war effort rather than luxury. Corridors to the
north and east lead to other areas of the officers' mess, whilst a pair of
thick ironwood doors are fixed in the western wall.

Lining the western and eastern walls of the quarters are a dozen large
wooden beds fitted with comfortable looking mattresses, a good bed to sleep
in being one of the few luxuries afforded to the officers of the White
Dragonarmy. Overall the room is relatively clean with only a small amount
of dust accumulating from place to place and it looks as though it is

Lining the western and eastern walls of the quarters are a dozen large
wooden beds fitted with comfortable looking mattresses, a good bed to sleep
in being one of the few luxuries afforded to the officers of the White
Dragonarmy. Overall the room is relatively clean with only a small amount
of dust accumulating from place to place and it looks as though it is

[36mThe Officer's Sleeping Quarters[0;37m
    These smaller quarters are significantly darker than the rest of the
officer's mess, with no lanterns or windows to provide light to the area.
Lining the western and eastern walls of the quarters are a dozen large
wooden beds fitted with comfortable looking mattresses, a good bed to sleep
in being one of the few luxuries afforded to the officers of the White
Dragonarmy. Overall the room is relatively clean with only a small amount
of dust accumulating from place to place and it looks as though it is
relatively well maintained by its occupants.

[36mInside the Officer's Mess[0;37m
    Although structurally well built, this entrance hall lacks any finesse
or fashion. The walls are completely bare stone, there is no furniture
within eyeshot and the floor has been made of plain oaken floorboards. The
White Dragonarmy's leadership is obviously more concerned with devoting
their resources to their war effort rather than luxury. Corridors to the
north and east lead to other areas of the officers' mess, whilst a pair of
thick ironwood doors are fixed in the western wall.

    Long tables of polished oak fill this hall where the officers of the
White Dragonarmy come to savour brief moments of enjoyment as they devour
their meals. Each of the tables dominating the centre of the room is
flanked by two long oaken benches to provide seating arrangements for those
eating here. Dozens of empty plates and bowls scatter the tables, as it
seems more time is spent eating meals rather than cleaning up afterwards.
Dim light flickers through the room emanating from a candle bearing
chandelier that hangs gently from the ceiling and the room is filled with
the delicious aromas of gourmet food that seem to be coming from nearby.

[36mThe Officer's Dining Hall[0;37m
    Long tables of polished oak fill this hall where the officers of the
White Dragonarmy come to savour brief moments of enjoyment as they devour
their meals. Each of the tables dominating the centre of the room is
flanked by two long oaken benches to provide seating arrangements for those
eating here. Dozens of empty plates and bowls scatter the tables, as it
seems more time is spent eating meals rather than cleaning up afterwards.
Dim light flickers through the room emanating from a candle bearing
chandelier that hangs gently from the ceiling and the room is filled with
the delicious aromas of gourmet food that seem to be coming from nearby.

[36mA Beautifully Clean Kitchen[0;37m
    This pristine kitchen sparkles with cleanliness, starkly contrasting
the grimey officers' dining hall that lies just beyond the door. Long
benches of polished grey stone run around the edges of the room and various
types of shiny steel pots and cooking utensils cover their surfaces, all of
which are arranged in a meticulously organised manner. Hundreds of
different spices and seasonings stand in a line along the western wall next
to a monstrous mortar and pestle (quest?) that looks far too heavy to carry.
Whomever runs this kitchen clearly takes their job very seriously, as it is
quite possibly the most spotless cooking area in the entirety of Krynn.

    Grey dirt has been heavily compacted here to form a sandy path that
leads from the dusty training grounds where the recruits hone their battle
skills to a large stone building directly north of here. Tall banners of
pitch black cloth hang over the walls of the building emblazoned with the
snow white insignia of the White Dragonarmy. The stone building is well
constructed and made from thick stone, having been clearly designed as a
well fortified structure that can be used as a defensive position should
the training camp come under siege. Clouds of dust are occasionally blown
through the area, carried in from the dusty training grounds to the east by
gusts of wind that ebb and flow.

The robust health of the forest owes much to the wardens who dedicate their
lives to the upkeep of the trees. Calmer and more focused than their
brethren, these pigmies bear the patience required to guide and care for
the local flora over many years. Specialized claws allow them to scale and
reach the branches high above the woodland floor, ensuring no part of the
tree goes untended. The warden moves deliberately throughout the area,
pruning and encouraging growth of the vegetation in which the pigmies make
their home.
A pigmy tree warden looks pretty hurt.

    Large clumps of tall grass and thorny vines have grown into tangled
masses in this section of the forest. While most of the other areas have
been regularly maintained by the forest's inhabitants, for some reason this
place has been ignored, allowing it to become overgrown. The dense
vegetation makes moving about difficult, and the view of the sky above is
completely blocked out by a heavy canopy of foliage from nearby trees. Loud
rustling emanates from unseen locations periodically as small creatures
thrash about, but it is impossible to see where the sounds originate from.
