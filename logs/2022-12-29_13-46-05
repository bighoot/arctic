    The fortified walls of Tarsis rise up from the Plains of Dust like
mighty cliffs, defiant against the cold, harsh winds, and dwarfed only by
the fifty foot towers that nearly encircle the city. The ancient city walls
have withstood the tests of time, including the Cataclysm in all of its
fiery glory. Once called Tarsis the Beautiful, the Lordcity was a bustling
sea port, whose rich commerce brought sustainability and prosperity to the
land. The city now looks as desolate as the plains that surround it.
Tempestuous winds assail the walls with endless specks of sand, causing
minimal damage to the walls, but serving as a constant reminder that
nothing can survive forever in these wastelands.

[36mThe Road to Tarsis[0;37m
    This, the road to Tarsis, strides boldly through the Plains of Dust,
plunging eastward through the plains and west towards the exotic city of
Tarsis. Glacial winds gust in from the south, hampering your journey. The
plains respond to these forceful winds, born in the heart of Icewall, with
incredible dust storms that constantly threaten to encroach upon Tarsis and
the roads leading to her. Very few plants have the will or tenacity to try
growing on these rocky soils, and the slightest green of a stubborn moss is
a sight for sore eyes.

[36mEast Road Junction[0;37m
    A jaded, frigid, azure sky expands above you, a swirling sea of cloud
and wind. Pummeling you from the south, glacial winds send clouds of dust
billowing around you. The howling winds scream into your ears and tear at
your clothes, as if rogue, elemental scavengers. Barren, rocky soil offers
little comfort from the relentless winds, and the only sign of life you can
see is deep wagon ruts on this well-travelled road, most of which seem to
be headed east to west, towards the city of Tarsis.

    The road continues east and west here, surrounded by the chilly
monotony of the Plains of Dust. Icy gusts of wind tear relentlessly at you
from the south as they drift violently in from the depths of the Icewall
glaciers. Dry skies expand overhead, as rain is a commodity in these
parts of Krynn. You can barely make out Tarsis, lying nestled in the heart
of the plains west from here. More dust greets you to the east.

    The Plains of Dust surround you. Barren, rocky soil offers little
vegetation, only monotony. Icereach and the Icewall glacier cannot be seen
from this distance, though you can feel their bitter winds. This road winds
its way east to where the dust clouds that billow about the plains
diminish, and west towards the city of Tarsis. Pale white clouds hang
lazily in the air when you speak and breathe, until a strong gust of wind
destroys them. The landscape is barren and rocky, and your feet are numb
despite all efforts to protect them.

    Skirting the edge of a dry, dusty valley, the road winds its way down

howling gusts of wind offer a mere prelude to the dry Plains of Dust which
expand to the northwest. As you gaze over the contents of the valley, you
notice a small town nestled deep in the valley. Wisps of black smoke drift
lazily into the air, and signs of life become more apparant as there are
many visible footprints, not yet covered by dust.

other than those and a few shrubs, the hills are mostly barren. The fenced

    The trail continues to the east and west, along the edge of the Forest
of Silvanesti. Tall timbers line the sides of the path that creates a
quaint corridor effect. The trees seem to thin out here, giving way to a
more verdant landscape of various shrubbery. Animals trails intersect the
main path leading through the area. Mountain ranges are barely visible to
the north and to the east the terrain seems more rigid and bare. Traveling
here seems peaceful and unencumbered.

    Several climates converge on the groves of trees loosely dotting the
grassy landscape here, and signs of wildlife can be seen all throughout
the area. The lush forests to the south evoke a sense of peacefulness.
Mountains line the horizon to the north and rolling deserts far to the
east, while thick tree cover to the south denotes the legendary forests of
Silvanesti. An unkempt trail lingers from moderate traffic to the east and
west.

    The cruel sun beats down on the road here, cracking the dried soil.
The land here suffers badly from the unrelenting winds that blow across the
desert to the west. Lizards take shelter in the shadows of the rocks where
the sand is not hot enough to roast them, but there is no shade large
enough for larger animals. Each step sinks into the searing sand, the air
thick and hazy, each breath like drowning in lava.

[36mCrossing the Thon-Thalas River[0;37m
    The beating sun bakes the dirt road in such heat that the road has
cracked into what almost resembles cobblestones. Insects scurry across,
careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only
option is to continue either north or south.

    The road begins to narrow to the north as it grows steadily steeper.
Far in the distance, the road winds as it carves a path through the
foothills of the Khalkists. Vegetation is less sparse further up the
path, offering more sights for the arduous climb. The view to the south is
a stark contrast, as the road widens and flattens. For miles the road
continues straight with very little to see except for an expansive yellow
sea of sand.

    This narrow road winds a treacherous path through these grim foothills.
The trail is rocky and somewhat unstable, through clumps of pine trees and
the occasional hardwood, though other than that the terrain is rather
monotonous. The land is hilly, though not altogether rugged, as most of the
hillsides that comprise the area are grassy or covered with small rocks.
The jagged, violent peaks of the Khalkist Mountains sneer at you high

    The narrow road twists and winds around the larger foothills here.
These hills are the southern extent of the mightly Khalkist Mountains which
loom over you to the north. The peaks are such a bleak, dark grey, they
almost look charred against the sky. To the south the rocky road flattens
somewhat into more hilly foothills while those to the north only become
more treacherous and rocky. In the distance you can see faint signs of
smoke barely rising above the foothills far to the southwest.

    The lands of Ak-Tubal and Kalin Ak-Phan stretch out to the east. They
are flat, dry, grassy plains infamous for their unbearable heat during the
summer solstice. Although the conditions can be harsh, you can see several
clumps of hardwoods providing some shade for travellers. Far east beyond
the huge plains you can barely make out the glittering waves of the Khurman
Sea. The altitude descends north of there, though to the south you can see
the jagged, towering peaks of the mighty Khalkist Mountains.

the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves

exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western

an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large

charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

stove bread bakes to a fine golden brown. A bookshelf on the southern wall
holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a

unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

    Mud puddles line a path, leading directly into the back of a giant
dragon's mouth. A small opening is easily visible between the skull and the
mandible. The mud here has a strange sweet smell that is surprisingly
pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem
terrifyingly bigger than the ones seen above. Most of the hoofprints seem
to be leading east, where the mud gets thicker.

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes

region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of

[36mA Hot, Muddy Spring[0;37m
    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area
below.

an unseen source above. The result is an absolutely absurd amount of mud in

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

[36mBefore a Humble Inn[0;37m
    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

[36mJunction One[0;37m
    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

shaft, which lies directly to the west. To the north and south the Main Way
continues. The Deep Mine Main Shaft is the clear way back to the mountain
surface.

    A clear junction spot of the Main Way, the area is labeled with a huge

the north and west, clearly paths for mining carts along the Main Way.
Surprisingly, the tunnel east, while plenty big enough for the carts, has
no tracks leading in that direction. Villagers are plentiful in the area of
this junction, some chatting wildly with each other, while others sit on
the benches, which have been erected around the junction sign. Torches
bring an abundance of light to this underground tunnel.

    A remarkably sparkly chandelier adds pleasant luminescence to the room.
Instead of glass dangling down from it, fiery rubies glitter adding a red
tinge to the light of the chandelier. Against the northern wall of the
shop, a full smithy is set up. Apprentice and veteran smiths seem to use
it, both to manufacture products for the shop, as well as larger orders for
King Torak and King Hornfel. The western wall has a large area devoted to
ornamental additions to the smithed products as well as weaving stations
and strange gadgets. On the southern wall a large counter is set up as a
payment station, there is also a large exchange box on it. Strange
underground plants hang down from the ceiling. It seems like this ancient
store really sells just about anything a villager would need.
