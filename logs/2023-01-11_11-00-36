[36mThe Main Lift[0;37m
    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

[36mBottom of the Main Lift[0;37m
    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of
the mountain above. Complicated gears and pulleys seem to work together in
an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

[36mThe Entrance to Deep Mine[0;37m
    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their

Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below

Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a

    While dubbed the 'Golden Lane', this slender tunnel-path hardly passes
as anything greater than an alley. And though completely extravagant, gold
is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

    Amazingly bright, white light illuminates the 'lane' here, creating a
dramatic effect with the numerous jewels embedded into the buildings. In
this section of the alley, huge balconies seem to have become the trend.
Numerous couples seem to be enjoying fine wines and spirits, while eating
freshly barbequed meat. Here, laughing and happiness seem as common as they
do at the Burrow. The Golden Lane leads back toward the Main Way to the
east, and reaches its conclusion to the west.

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious
dwellings dominate the surrounding area, their size accomodated for easily
by the cavernous ceilings overhead. The sounds of banging and shouting
fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the

of disparate size lay besides boards of wood and piles of smooth stone
used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious

fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the

    Smooth white-washed stone walls characterize this spectacular mansion.
The floor is made of fine marble that has been immaculately cleaned,
polished, and glossed. Although there are no furnishings yet, this adds to
the spacious feeling within the mansion. A fine layer of dust coats the
area, as it is not yet visited by anyone outside of the construction guild.
The only real thing of note is the extremely odd contraption set into the
northern wall. Clearly a device of the Engineering Guild, it is unclear at

[36mWithin an Empty Mansion[0;37m
    Smooth white-washed stone walls characterize this spectacular mansion.
The floor is made of fine marble that has been immaculately cleaned,
polished, and glossed. Although there are no furnishings yet, this adds to
the spacious feeling within the mansion. A fine layer of dust coats the
area, as it is not yet visited by anyone outside of the construction guild.
The only real thing of note is the extremely odd contraption set into the
northern wall. Clearly a device of the Engineering Guild, it is unclear at
first glance what it actually does. The mansion can be exited to the east.

Extending from all four of the wide frontal windows are stone balconies.
Low walls enclose each, preventing the residents from falling. Debris still

[36mThrough the Construction[0;37m
    Signs of active construction surround the area; hammers and picks
of disparate size lay besides boards of wood and piles of smooth stone
used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious
dwellings dominate the surrounding area, their size accomodated for easily
by the cavernous ceilings overhead. The sounds of banging and shouting
fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the
residents. Judging by the pace the Construction Guild works at, that time
is not far off.

[36mBefore a Finished Mansion[0;37m
    The expanding Golden Lane abruptly halts at the front of an impressive
new mansion. The tunnel floor has been cleared of the vast majority of its
rubble, yet there is still the feel of construction. Expensive pieces of
furniture are continually being pushed through the beautiful doors of the
new mansion, and the banging of hammers and scraping of stone can be
readily heard in all directions. While most of the work seems to be on
surrounding structures, a few dwarves work to polish off the external and
internal parts of the mansion. A soft white light illuminates the area from
above. A solid wooden door, with a labelling of crossed tools, serves as
the entrance to a temporary toolshed, used by the construction guild. To
the south the construction continues.

[36mBefore a Finished Mansion[0;37m
    The expanding Golden Lane abruptly halts at the front of an impressive
new mansion. The tunnel floor has been cleared of the vast majority of its
rubble, yet there is still the feel of construction. Expensive pieces of
furniture are continually being pushed through the beautiful doors of the
new mansion, and the banging of hammers and scraping of stone can be
readily heard in all directions. While most of the work seems to be on
surrounding structures, a few dwarves work to polish off the external and
internal parts of the mansion. A soft white light illuminates the area from
above. A solid wooden door, with a labelling of crossed tools, serves as
the entrance to a temporary toolshed, used by the construction guild. To
the south the construction continues.

    Construction tools have been neatly ordered, and put in place within

    Construction tools have been neatly ordered, and put in place within
this small, make-shift toolshed. A strong smell of sawdust saturates the
shed. A large blueprint of the finished mansion has been pinned up against
the eastern wall here. A few crates have been stacked up in the southern
corner of the shed. There are quite a few tools of interest here, and
definitely some you do not recognize. West leads back into the mansion.

[36mBefore a Finished Mansion[0;37m
    The expanding Golden Lane abruptly halts at the front of an impressive
new mansion. The tunnel floor has been cleared of the vast majority of its
rubble, yet there is still the feel of construction. Expensive pieces of
furniture are continually being pushed through the beautiful doors of the
new mansion, and the banging of hammers and scraping of stone can be
readily heard in all directions. While most of the work seems to be on
surrounding structures, a few dwarves work to polish off the external and
internal parts of the mansion. A soft white light illuminates the area from
above. A solid wooden door, with a labelling of crossed tools, serves as
the entrance to a temporary toolshed, used by the construction guild. To
the south the construction continues.

[36mThrough the Construction[0;37m
    Signs of active construction surround the area; hammers and picks
of disparate size lay besides boards of wood and piles of smooth stone
used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious
dwellings dominate the surrounding area, their size accomodated for easily
by the cavernous ceilings overhead. The sounds of banging and shouting
fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the
residents. Judging by the pace the Construction Guild works at, that time
is not far off.

    Chunks of stone litter the floor of this newly excavated tunnel, the
jagged edges posing no serious hindrance to the nimble traveller. A wooden
fence has been put up to the south, a line of demarkation between the old
and new tunnels hewn by the dwarves. To the east, someone has took the time to
carve the stone ceiling into a well-formed arch, adding a more official look
to whatever lies in that direction.

This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

Nearly a decade has passed since the original construction of this palace.
King Torak recently invested a heavy chunk of the dwarven treasury towards
a series of upgrades and maintenance projects, resulting in the current
glorious state of the palace. The palace itself has dimensions of a
half-thousand meters squared, and has been constructed in perfect
symmetry. Door sized windows with the curtains drawn line up and down the
dual level, white-washed walls of the palace. Statuettes that depict the
dwarven kings of old stare down at you with pride from atop the roof of the
palace. A majestic entryway greets newcomers to the south with massive
columns of granite crowned by perfect marble arches.

granite columns lined up on both the left and right hand sides. Columns on
opposite sides are paired together by magnificiently perfect marble arches
that were constructed without a drop of cement to hold them together. The
arches are held together solely by the massive pressure each brick exerts
on the other. Suspended on top of the arches is a domed quartz roof that
casts a bright hue down upon the lavish red carpet that has been rolled out
here. An honor guard post has been set up just south of here to monitor the
entrance of visitors. At the end of the open aired entryway stand large
golden doors leading into the palace. Above the doors a massive seal of the
dwarven kings occupies the remaining space.

and official looking papers stands in the middle of the post. A few chairs
line the eastern wall, and glass windows facing out into the entryway allow

acoustics of this hall are mind boggling. The architects seem to have
designed it in such a way that sound would barely travel. It would seem
that someone, most likely the King, did not want to be disturbed by the
sounds of dwarves marching through this hall. Bright torches illuminate the
hall and draw your attention towards paintings depicting the successive
line of dwarven monarchs. The hall continues west deep into the heart of

    A huge room at the heart of the palace extends here. It is here where
Torak gathers to hold audience with the common dwarves who seek his
jurisprudence. The House of Nobles also reunites here to hold council when
Torak summons them. At the front of the room stand a line of throne like
chairs that host the royal family. Three chairs in the middle stand at a
higher ground than the others, but even these are at different heights. The
highest, largest, and most intricate chair is that of the King. To it's
right the second highest, and largest chair belongs to the heir to the
throne. To the left standing slightly above the others is the chair of the
King's consort. A red carpet extends from the doors to the chamber to just
before the steps leading to the King's throne. To the left and right of the
carpet are rows of chairs for guests and nobles to assist the proceedings.
Torches illuminate the chamber, and a large tapestry reveals its beautiful
patterns in the bright light. The grand hall extends to the east back
towards the entryway.

diagonal arches supporting a hemispherical roof. The four arches meet
every five meters as the hall extends to form four perpendicular angles.
The floor beneath you is made of smooth, flowing marble. Bright torches
illuminate the hall and a beautiful, polished suit of armour left over
from the Dwarf Gate Wars stands silently watching you. To the north a

    The flowing marble of the floor spirals majestically upwards in the
form of a grand stairway. A royal red carpet with gold trims adorns the
center of the stairs, but does not blot out the amazing marble work present
here. Silver rails lines the stairway for both visual enjoyment and safety.
A series of murals depicting dwarven culture have been carefully etched
into the walls of the palace to complement the grand stairway. Far above a

    Just south of the grand stairway a hall opens up here expanding
westwards to the royal apartments. The hall is quite wide given the
relatively small amount of traffic it receives. This part of the palace
is frequented usually only by the royal family and their servants. Light
streaming from a pyromancer carving illuminates the passage. Immaculate
marble floors, and diagonal arches supporting a domed roof remain the
trademark of the palace here. A gorgeous array of flowers stands against
the eastern wall, while the southern wall is adorned by a painting of the
entire royal family together.

household to the servant's commons. It's plush cushions offer comfort to
off-duty workers. At the rooms center stands a four-legged table: wooden
and sturdy. Atop the table is a stout cask of dwarven spirits and a few
decks of cards. It is clear that these dwarven servants are allowed to
enjoy themselves in their time off. The servant's intersection lies to the
north, a gnomish time keeping device ticks above the couch on the southern
wall. The room has been lit by a dim candle in the northwestern corner.

    A small torch hinged into the wall lights this intersection of paths

an exit from the region of the servants, while exits to both the east and

is frequented usually only by the royal family and their servants. Light
streaming from a pyromancer carving illuminates the passage. Immaculate

jurisprudence. The House of Nobles also reunites here to hold council when
Torak summons them. At the front of the room stand a line of throne like
chairs that host the royal family. Three chairs in the middle stand at a
higher ground than the others, but even these are at different heights. The
highest, largest, and most intricate chair is that of the King. To it's
right the second highest, and largest chair belongs to the heir to the
throne. To the left standing slightly above the others is the chair of the
King's consort. A red carpet extends from the doors to the chamber to just
before the steps leading to the King's throne. To the left and right of the
carpet are rows of chairs for guests and nobles to assist the proceedings.
Torches illuminate the chamber, and a large tapestry reveals its beautiful
patterns in the bright light. The grand hall extends to the east back
towards the entryway.

[36mEntryway[0;37m
    King Torak has been known to pass judgements based on first
appearances. Apparently Torak had this in mind when he ordered the addition
of this awing entryway to the palace. The entryway consists of a dozen
granite columns lined up on both the left and right hand sides. Columns on
opposite sides are paired together by magnificiently perfect marble arches
that were constructed without a drop of cement to hold them together. The
arches are held together solely by the massive pressure each brick exerts
on the other. Suspended on top of the arches is a domed quartz roof that
casts a bright hue down upon the lavish red carpet that has been rolled out
here. An honor guard post has been set up just south of here to monitor the
entrance of visitors. At the end of the open aired entryway stand large
golden doors leading into the palace. Above the doors a massive seal of the
dwarven kings occupies the remaining space.

[36mEntryway[0;37m
    King Torak has been known to pass judgements based on first
appearances. Apparently Torak had this in mind when he ordered the addition
of this awing entryway to the palace. The entryway consists of a dozen
granite columns lined up on both the left and right hand sides. Columns on
opposite sides are paired together by magnificiently perfect marble arches
that were constructed without a drop of cement to hold them together. The
arches are held together solely by the massive pressure each brick exerts
on the other. Suspended on top of the arches is a domed quartz roof that
casts a bright hue down upon the lavish red carpet that has been rolled out
here. An honor guard post has been set up just south of here to monitor the
entrance of visitors. At the end of the open aired entryway stand large
golden doors leading into the palace. Above the doors a massive seal of the
dwarven kings occupies the remaining space.

    The majestic retreat of King Torak stands proudly just meters away.
Nearly a decade has passed since the original construction of this palace.
King Torak recently invested a heavy chunk of the dwarven treasury towards
a series of upgrades and maintenance projects, resulting in the current
glorious state of the palace. The palace itself has dimensions of a
half-thousand meters squared, and has been constructed in perfect
symmetry. Door sized windows with the curtains drawn line up and down the
dual level, white-washed walls of the palace. Statuettes that depict the
dwarven kings of old stare down at you with pride from atop the roof of the
palace. A majestic entryway greets newcomers to the south with massive
columns of granite crowned by perfect marble arches.

have caught and reflected the brightness of both the westwards and

the fortune that is of the dwarves awes even the richest of foreigners.

[36mThe End of the Golden Lane[0;37m
    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

    From this vista point a beautiful glow, from the lower levels of the
cavern is readily visible. The rock formations in this area seem to be very
low cut, as even the shortest of dwarves, would easily tower over the
rocks. This leads to an area of heightened interest for the children of
Deep Mine to play. Evidently, the piles of quartz gravel made to look like
castles, were not the original intentions of the gardeners. The path
continues to more peaceful areas of the park, both to the north and south.

    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

    Fabulous aromas assault the senses from all sides of this compact
kitchen. Over the fire-pit a huge pig is roasting slowly, while at the
stove bread bakes to a fine golden brown. A bookshelf on the southern wall
holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a
priest of Reorx. A window set on the northern wall is open, in the
unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,
while the backdoor of the Burrow is framed near the window.

    This make shift camp seems to serve as a residence for a group of young
dwarven hunters from Deep Mine. Scattered pans and pots filled with old
stews intermingle with a variety of long spears. The mess is indicative of
the young dwarves's bachelorhood; no respectable dwarven woman would be
taking care of this group of swine and filth. A small fire burns in the

    Dark gray walls climb to the ceiling of this massive stalagmite.
Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the

[35mThe Halls of Myth[0;37m
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.
