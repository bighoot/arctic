decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

marks. To the south, lies the northern gate of Solace, and to the north,
the road continues. Large bushes block your view to the east and west.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

[36mThe End of a Tunnel[0;37m
    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the
tunnel continues into darkness.

    The tunnel takes an abrupt turn here, leading into darkness both south

source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

[36mThe End of a Hall[0;37m
    Open doorways lead north and south from here, and a dark wood paneled
hallway runs straight to the east. Taking up a majority of the western wall
is a gate of light brown stone, set into a smooth archway that stands as
tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though
the safest path is anyone's guess.

[36mIntersecting Halls[0;37m
    Dark wooden panels make up the walls of the two hallways that converge
here, and dirt trails the floor following them both. Down the western
hallway you can hardly miss a large gate that stands directly at the end of
it, while the southern hallway stops at a flight of stairs that lead up to
a higher floor. The only thing of interest here appears to be a wooden door
leading east.

    Oaken panels stained dark line the sides of the hall, and also end it
in a solid wall to the south. From here you can access the floor above
this, what would be ground level in this subterranean building, by a flight
of stairs against the southern wall. Though you can't see into it very well
from here, you can feel the breeze of freshly circulated air from the room
above, a welcome change from the stagnant and stale air of these
underground halls. To the north the hallway you are in, meets up with
another hallway running east-west.

branch out from it's base to hold the sacrifice, and a sharp blade
protrudes in between their grip to thrust through the victim's chest. At
the base of the altar a bowl rests in the gaping maw of a dragon's head
crafted of the same silver, full of blood from the latest human sacrifice

profusely, he manages to keep from slipping into unconciousness long enough
to speak his last words. "I came here... with two more... free them from the
dungeon... check folds of my shirt f..." With those words the scout's eyes
lose their focus and his head drops silently to his chest. Reaching into his

    The stone walls here are obscured by black curtains that hang loosely
from the ceiling. Rising up from the floor near the south wall is a
sacrificial altar made of pure silver. Two arms ending in sharp claws
branch out from it's base to hold the sacrifice, and a sharp blade
protrudes in between their grip to thrust through the victim's chest. At
the base of the altar a bowl rests in the gaping maw of a dragon's head
crafted of the same silver, full of blood from the latest human sacrifice
to the goddess Takhisis.

stairs lead up to a circular pedestal with a massive portal framed by shiny
bronze beams. The surface of the portal swirls slowly in a hypnotic pattern,
inviting you to touch it.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

Realizing it will take full mental focus to understand the contents of the
book, you pray briefly to your deity for guidance and open the book to the
first page.
After a brief prayer to your deity, you flip open the disgusting cover and
begin to study the pages. Amazingly, the book is a compilation of thousands
of curses cast and committed to the written page. You ingrain each symbol
onto your mind until you finally have the proper incantations. You hastily
add, 'negative plane protection' to your prayerbooks.
The skin on the cover begins to boil and turn to goo. A foul odor of
burning flesh emanates from within the disgusting book and you drop it
immediately. The entire book rots before your eyes.

    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

civilization rise from the village of Solace. As the trail follows the
curve of the lake it heads south along the shoreline, and to the east where
it rounds another bend.

    Weaving its way around a corner of the lake, this small trail runs
between Crystalmir and a dense forest of pine. Squirrels chatter as they
dart from tree to tree in a frenetic chase, startling a red-headed
woodpecker into flight. The sunlight trickles through the forest of dense
evergreens, which cover the ground to the south and east. To the north and
west the sandy trail continues along the shoreline.

    You are at the corner of a large lake, which fills your vision far to
the west before ending at high, jagged cliffs. The forest of pine that this
trail winds through thins out to the north and east, where large fields of
grain can be seen. The pine-covered trail follows the shoreline to the
south into thicker woods and north.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.
