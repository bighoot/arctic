[36mA Small Side Street[0;37m
    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    A narrow road leads deep into a thick forest of very tall trees and

but not as many as to the south. The road runs in the near shadows of the
Kharolis mountains which can be seen off to the west, beyond a great lake.
The mountains appear to run north for some distance before ending. The
plains spread out to the north from here for many leagues.

    The yellowish sands seamlessly slope into the waters of Newsea as the
waters ebb and flow along the shoreline. The sounds of the sea rhythmically
wash alongst the shore, offering a consistent melody. The caw of sea birds
can be heard before they are seen, taking off and landing atop the waters
to the west. The sandy beach leads eastwards and comes to a trailhead,
leading through some verdant rolling hills. The sky is partially cloudy,
and a drizzle of rain can be felt from time to time.

    The trail descends rapidly, the end of which can be seen leading to a
sandy shoreline. The waters of Newsea can be seen rushing onto the shore,
staining the sand with moisture. Far to the southeast, beyond the hills,
the terrain opens up into a vast desert known as the Plains of Dust. There
is almost a distinguishable line where the sands from the plains meets the
grass at the edge of the hills. The sun warms the hills, but some light
gray rain clouds can be seen moving in from the west.

two lies the ruins of Brukt, a long since destroyed ogre town. The green

    A shady grove offers a cool place to rest at this intersection. The
rolling grasslands to the south extend beyond sight, running parallel to
the forest of Silvanesti. The southern tip of the Khalkist mountains lies a
great distance towards the west, and rise up like towering giants. Beyond
that, though not visible, lies the waters of New Sea. Ogre Peaks and Onyx
Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name
suggests, is home to many ogres. The land to the north is a mighty plain
known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.

    The edge of a great forest lies to the south, filled with ancient

The trees and foliage provide an impassable barrier to entering the forest
from here, forming a natural border with the rest of the world. To the east
and west, a well travelled path continues east along the edge of the forest,
and west to an intersection. To the north, you can see the plains of Blode
in the distance, which are home to towns and cities alike.

[36mBefore an Arid Desert[0;37m
    The cruel sun beats down on the road here, cracking the dried soil.
The land here suffers badly from the unrelenting winds that blow across the
desert to the west. Lizards take shelter in the shadows of the rocks where
the sand is not hot enough to roast them, but there is no shade large
enough for larger animals. Each step sinks into the searing sand, the air
thick and hazy, each breath like drowning in lava.

    The beating sun bakes the dirt road in such heat that the road has
cracked into what almost resembles cobblestones. Insects scurry across,
careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only
option is to continue either north or south.

    The road begins to narrow to the north as it grows steadily steeper.
Far in the distance, the road winds as it carves a path through the
foothills of the Khalkists. Vegetation is less sparse further up the
path, offering more sights for the arduous climb. The view to the south is
a stark contrast, as the road widens and flattens. For miles the road
continues straight with very little to see except for an expansive yellow
sea of sand.

    This narrow road winds a treacherous path through these grim foothills.
The trail is rocky and somewhat unstable, through clumps of pine trees and
the occasional hardwood, though other than that the terrain is rather
monotonous. The land is hilly, though not altogether rugged, as most of the
hillsides that comprise the area are grassy or covered with small rocks.
The jagged, violent peaks of the Khalkist Mountains sneer at you high
above to the north.

    The narrow road twists and winds around the larger foothills here.
These hills are the southern extent of the mightly Khalkist Mountains which
loom over you to the north. The peaks are such a bleak, dark grey, they
almost look charred against the sky. To the south the rocky road flattens
somewhat into more hilly foothills while those to the north only become
more treacherous and rocky. In the distance you can see faint signs of
smoke barely rising above the foothills far to the southwest.

around you. Gazing to the west you notice a huge column of black smoke
rising into the air.  Occasionally the ground here shakes almost
imperceptibly, trembling in response to the volcano in the distance.

    The lands of Ak-Tubal and Kalin Ak-Phan stretch out to the east. They
are flat, dry, grassy plains infamous for their unbearable heat during the
summer solstice. Although the conditions can be harsh, you can see several
clumps of hardwoods providing some shade for travellers. Far east beyond
the huge plains you can barely make out the glittering waves of the Khurman
Sea. The altitude descends north of there, though to the south you can see
the jagged, towering peaks of the mighty Khalkist Mountains.

    This rough road winds its way through foothills near the Khalkist
Mountains which lay to the west. Lush, flat plains extend to the east and
northeast. These hills are green, dotted by the occasional dark grey
boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or
civilization can be seen in sight, as there are few footprints and no wagon
ruts on this rugged road.

near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the

the great city of Delphon or beginning the trek to Port Balifor which rests
southeast of here, along the shores of the Khurman Sea. The breeze dies

    Plains expand all around you from this parched, hot dry road. The dirt
of which the road is made is cracked and dry with lack of moisture, and
very few plants other than the occasional cactus dare grow in such a trying

crossroad is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and merchants
alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on
the Blood Sea northeast of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder

few trees that brave the heat of the relentless summer suns, and several
travelers rest in the shade of these large hardwoods. You can see the
sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south, and the smell of the sea is
strong in the air, the glittering, placid waters of the Bay of Balifor
being visible to the west.  Curving north and to the west, the dusty
road continues along the rolling plains.

    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of
the mountain above. Complicated gears and pulleys seem to work together in
an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

[36mThe Entrance to Deep Mine[0;37m
    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

[36mBefore a Humble Inn[0;37m
    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

[36mBefore a Humble Inn[0;37m
    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

[36mJunction One[0;37m
    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

    The wide tunnel of the Main Way continues through this much more
residential area of the village. At first glance it appears as the rest of
the main tunnel but little doors in the tunnel, reveal homes dug into the
side walls. Deep treads in the center of the road, indicate the path of the
mining carts to both the west and south. Mounted torches, light this region
from the ceiling down. The way south leads to a junction in the tunnel,
while the way west moves through the residential district.

[36mDeep Mine Main Way[0;37m
    In this residential area of Deep Mine, some homes have been dug
directly into the side of the tunnel. Against the western wall, however, a
large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.
Torches set near the ceiling, brighten this residential area.

[36mThe Golden Lane[0;37m
    While dubbed the 'Golden Lane', this slender tunnel-path hardly passes
as anything greater than an alley. And though completely extravagant, gold
is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

    Amazingly bright, white light illuminates the 'lane' here, creating a
dramatic effect with the numerous jewels embedded into the buildings. In
this section of the alley, huge balconies seem to have become the trend.
Numerous couples seem to be enjoying fine wines and spirits, while eating
freshly barbequed meat. Here, laughing and happiness seem as common as they
do at the Burrow. The Golden Lane leads back toward the Main Way to the
east, and reaches its conclusion to the west.

[36mThe End of the Golden Lane[0;37m
    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

[36mThrough the Construction[0;37m
    Signs of active construction surround the area; hammers and picks
of disparate size lay besides boards of wood and piles of smooth stone
used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious
dwellings dominate the surrounding area, their size accomodated for easily
by the cavernous ceilings overhead. The sounds of banging and shouting
fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the
residents. Judging by the pace the Construction Guild works at, that time
is not far off.

littered with random tools, nuts, and bolts. The heavy resources have
unsettled a huge cloud of dust, which permeates the air here.

    Signs of active construction surround the area; hammers and picks

used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious
dwellings dominate the surrounding area, their size accomodated for easily
by the cavernous ceilings overhead. The sounds of banging and shouting
fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the
residents. Judging by the pace the Construction Guild works at, that time
is not far off.

    A massive crest of crossed hammers regally adorns an otherwise bare
eastern wall, indicating that this room belongs to the foreman of the Deep
Mine Construction Guild. Beneath a flat stone table, metallic scraps and
chunks of stone lay scattered besides a broken board of wood, all pushed
together into a large pile in a hurried attempt to clean the floor. It is a
surprise how any thinking could get done in here, as the sounds of sawing,
shouting, and even the occasional explosion pierce the silence.

You return the slab to Groth, who briefly snorts in malcontent. 'That
rock-brained dwarf should know this slab is too thick for the floor.',
mutters the Foreman. He procures a sharp file with a thin blade, and cuts
off a layer of marble so thin, that you wonder if he even did anything at
all. 'There, that's better. Now if you would be very kind, lad, run this
to the western mansion where it's needed.'

A small slit in the door slides open and two beady eyes peer out.
"Well its about time! Get in here. I've been waiting for that to

The door swings open.

A mason worker quickly grabs the fine marble slab from your hands
and rushes into the room.

The floor is made of fine marble that has been immaculately cleaned,
polished, and glossed. Although there are no furnishings yet, this adds to
the spacious feeling within the mansion. A fine layer of dust coats the

[36mThrough the Construction[0;37m
    Signs of active construction surround the area; hammers and picks
of disparate size lay besides boards of wood and piles of smooth stone
used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious
dwellings dominate the surrounding area, their size accomodated for easily
by the cavernous ceilings overhead. The sounds of banging and shouting
fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the
residents. Judging by the pace the Construction Guild works at, that time
is not far off.

[36mBefore a Finished Mansion[0;37m
    The expanding Golden Lane abruptly halts at the front of an impressive
new mansion. The tunnel floor has been cleared of the vast majority of its
rubble, yet there is still the feel of construction. Expensive pieces of
furniture are continually being pushed through the beautiful doors of the
new mansion, and the banging of hammers and scraping of stone can be
readily heard in all directions. While most of the work seems to be on
surrounding structures, a few dwarves work to polish off the external and

[36mBefore a Finished Mansion[0;37m
    The expanding Golden Lane abruptly halts at the front of an impressive
new mansion. The tunnel floor has been cleared of the vast majority of its
rubble, yet there is still the feel of construction. Expensive pieces of
furniture are continually being pushed through the beautiful doors of the
new mansion, and the banging of hammers and scraping of stone can be
readily heard in all directions. While most of the work seems to be on
surrounding structures, a few dwarves work to polish off the external and
internal parts of the mansion. A soft white light illuminates the area from
above. A solid wooden door, with a labelling of crossed tools, serves as
the entrance to a temporary toolshed, used by the construction guild. To
the south the construction continues.

[36mThrough the Construction[0;37m
    Signs of active construction surround the area; hammers and picks
of disparate size lay besides boards of wood and piles of smooth stone
used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious
dwellings dominate the surrounding area, their size accomodated for easily
by the cavernous ceilings overhead. The sounds of banging and shouting
fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the
residents. Judging by the pace the Construction Guild works at, that time
is not far off.

carve the stone ceiling into a well-formed arch, adding a more official look

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

have caught and reflected the brightness of both the westwards and

would almost seem that one was outside. The gems glimmer in the light and
the fortune that is of the dwarves awes even the richest of foreigners.

[36mBefore King Torak's Retreat[0;37m
    The majestic retreat of King Torak stands proudly just meters away.
Nearly a decade has passed since the original construction of this palace.
King Torak recently invested a heavy chunk of the dwarven treasury towards
a series of upgrades and maintenance projects, resulting in the current
glorious state of the palace. The palace itself has dimensions of a
half-thousand meters squared, and has been constructed in perfect
symmetry. Door sized windows with the curtains drawn line up and down the
dual level, white-washed walls of the palace. Statuettes that depict the
dwarven kings of old stare down at you with pride from atop the roof of the
palace. A majestic entryway greets newcomers to the south with massive
columns of granite crowned by perfect marble arches.

[36mBefore King Torak's Retreat[0;37m
    The majestic retreat of King Torak stands proudly just meters away.
Nearly a decade has passed since the original construction of this palace.
King Torak recently invested a heavy chunk of the dwarven treasury towards
a series of upgrades and maintenance projects, resulting in the current
glorious state of the palace. The palace itself has dimensions of a
half-thousand meters squared, and has been constructed in perfect
symmetry. Door sized windows with the curtains drawn line up and down the
dual level, white-washed walls of the palace. Statuettes that depict the
dwarven kings of old stare down at you with pride from atop the roof of the
palace. A majestic entryway greets newcomers to the south with massive
columns of granite crowned by perfect marble arches.

[36mBefore King Torak's Retreat[0;37m
    The majestic retreat of King Torak stands proudly just meters away.
Nearly a decade has passed since the original construction of this palace.
King Torak recently invested a heavy chunk of the dwarven treasury towards
a series of upgrades and maintenance projects, resulting in the current
glorious state of the palace. The palace itself has dimensions of a
half-thousand meters squared, and has been constructed in perfect
symmetry. Door sized windows with the curtains drawn line up and down the
dual level, white-washed walls of the palace. Statuettes that depict the
dwarven kings of old stare down at you with pride from atop the roof of the
palace. A majestic entryway greets newcomers to the south with massive
columns of granite crowned by perfect marble arches.

    King Torak has been known to pass judgements based on first
appearances. Apparently Torak had this in mind when he ordered the addition
of this awing entryway to the palace. The entryway consists of a dozen
granite columns lined up on both the left and right hand sides. Columns on
opposite sides are paired together by magnificiently perfect marble arches
that were constructed without a drop of cement to hold them together. The
arches are held together solely by the massive pressure each brick exerts
on the other. Suspended on top of the arches is a domed quartz roof that
casts a bright hue down upon the lavish red carpet that has been rolled out
here. An honor guard post has been set up just south of here to monitor the
entrance of visitors. At the end of the open aired entryway stand large
golden doors leading into the palace. Above the doors a massive seal of the
dwarven kings occupies the remaining space.

    This small, yet elegant post serves as a station for Torak's honorguard
to supervise, and log who enters and exits the palace. The posts smooth
brick walls have had images of the prestigious honorguard's role throughout
history chiselled into them. A marble table with neatly stacked log books
and official looking papers stands in the middle of the post. A few chairs
line the eastern wall, and glass windows facing out into the entryway allow
those in the room to view, and stop if necessary, newcomers to the palace.

into the heart of the palace. The hall has been masterfully crafted with
diagonal arches supporting a hemispherical roof. The four arches meet
every five meters as the hall extends to form four perpendicular angles.
The floor beneath you is made of smooth, flowing marble. Bright torches
illuminate the hall and a beautiful, polished suit of armour left over
from the Dwarf Gate Wars stands silently watching you. To the north a
grand stairway unfolds itself, while to the west the hall continues with
all sorts of paintings, artifacts, and glorious memorabilia of the
dwarven kings.

arches providing the hall perfect symmetry continue to meet here. The
acoustics of this hall are mind boggling. The architects seem to have
designed it in such a way that sound would barely travel. It would seem
that someone, most likely the King, did not want to be disturbed by the
sounds of dwarves marching through this hall. Bright torches illuminate the
hall and draw your attention towards paintings depicting the successive
line of dwarven monarchs. The hall continues west deep into the heart of

the entryway.

    A huge room at the heart of the palace extends here. It is here where
Torak gathers to hold audience with the common dwarves who seek his
jurisprudence. The House of Nobles also reunites here to hold council when
Torak summons them. At the front of the room stand a line of throne like
chairs that host the royal family. Three chairs in the middle stand at a
higher ground than the others, but even these are at different heights. The
highest, largest, and most intricate chair is that of the King. To it's
right the second highest, and largest chair belongs to the heir to the

King's consort. A red carpet extends from the doors to the chamber to just
before the steps leading to the King's throne. To the left and right of the
carpet are rows of chairs for guests and nobles to assist the proceedings.
Torches illuminate the chamber, and a large tapestry reveals its beautiful
patterns in the bright light. The grand hall extends to the east back
towards the entryway.

    The grand hall seems to be nearing its final destination deep in the
heart of the palace. Silver doors bearing the seal of the dwarven kings
loom before you to the west. The hall itself has reached a crescendo of
glory. A stunning statue smelted with a variety of the finest metals stands
against the northern wall depicting the dwarven God, Reorx. A beautiful
golden sceptre encrusted with priceless jewels lies just to right of the
statue. The columns and arches common to the rest of the hall are here as
well, from the arches hang banners depicting the coats of arms of all the
dwarven noble families of Deep Mine.

[36mGrand Hall[0;37m
    The grand hall continues here in all its historical glory. Masterful
arches providing the hall perfect symmetry continue to meet here. The
acoustics of this hall are mind boggling. The architects seem to have
designed it in such a way that sound would barely travel. It would seem
that someone, most likely the King, did not want to be disturbed by the
sounds of dwarves marching through this hall. Bright torches illuminate the
hall and draw your attention towards paintings depicting the successive
line of dwarven monarchs. The hall continues west deep into the heart of
the palace, while a ways down to the east you can see the golden doors of
the entryway.

    Just past the entryway the grand hall greets you and offers a path deep
into the heart of the palace. The hall has been masterfully crafted with
diagonal arches supporting a hemispherical roof. The four arches meet
every five meters as the hall extends to form four perpendicular angles.
The floor beneath you is made of smooth, flowing marble. Bright torches
illuminate the hall and a beautiful, polished suit of armour left over
from the Dwarf Gate Wars stands silently watching you. To the north a
grand stairway unfolds itself, while to the west the hall continues with
all sorts of paintings, artifacts, and glorious memorabilia of the
dwarven kings.

    A large cathedral like dome extends well above the top of the stairway
here. A very large diamond chandelier hangs from the center of the dome
shining its refragmented lights all across the dome. Every sound in this
room seems to resonate here due to the acoustics. The overlying effect is
the chandelier vibrates and the lights sprinkle across the ceiling taking
on the image of a raining rainbow. A hall opens up to the south of here
extending to the personal chambers of the royal family. Below the grand
stairway leads back towards the entryway.

[36mHall of Chambers[0;37m
    Just south of the grand stairway a hall opens up here expanding
westwards to the royal apartments. The hall is quite wide given the
relatively small amount of traffic it receives. This part of the palace
is frequented usually only by the royal family and their servants. Light
streaming from a pyromancer carving illuminates the passage. Immaculate
marble floors, and diagonal arches supporting a domed roof remain the
trademark of the palace here. A gorgeous array of flowers stands against
the eastern wall, while the southern wall is adorned by a painting of the
entire royal family together.

    Small glow worms traverse the holed surface of this beautiful rock
formation. The worms seem younger than those found in the garden,
constantly ducking into holes, only to quickly reappear. While their glow
is unimpressive, they do manage to provide light in the area. Some
interesting vegetation seems to be growing within the holes of the rock
formation, but it would be impossible to get any-sized fingers through the
holes to collect a sample. The wall of the palace lies to the south.

    Flawless white marble extends over the top of some rock formations of
the Deep Mine Rock Garden. The balcony's northern fence is inlaid with
alternating rows of amethysts, emeralds, and sapphires adding beautiful
color to the pleasant glow which reaches here from the many glow worms
below. The balcony is wide and furnished with a few comfortable full length
chairs, which are clearly of gnomish design as they have the ability to
fold into different positions at the touch of a big black button. The royal
reading room can be seen to the south.

a variety of musical scrolls rest near a plush purple cushion. The next
area is dedicated to card games, apparently the Queen and her husband enjoy
a good game of bridge with the two princes, when time permits. Finally, a
lush sofa and an extensive library indicate the area of the room, which
gives it its name. The royal bedroom lies to the west, while through the
sliding windows to the north the balcony can be reached.

    A dazzling purple glow, emitted from strange devices carved by the
pyromancers in conjunction with the gnomes, illuminates the western end of
the hall. A huge double-doored entryway provides access to the royal
chambers. The doors are well-wrought mithril laced with a spiralling gold
paint, the perfect mix of security and aesthetics. Against the southern
wall hangs a collection of war banners, while a door-sized window on the
northern wall overlooks the beautiful rock garden of Deep Mine. The red

    A dazzling purple glow, emitted from strange devices carved by the
pyromancers in conjunction with the gnomes, illuminates the western end of
the hall. A huge double-doored entryway provides access to the royal
chambers. The doors are well-wrought mithril laced with a spiralling gold
paint, the perfect mix of security and aesthetics. Against the southern
wall hangs a collection of war banners, while a door-sized window on the
northern wall overlooks the beautiful rock garden of Deep Mine. The red

[36mGrand Hall[0;37m
    Just past the entryway the grand hall greets you and offers a path deep
into the heart of the palace. The hall has been masterfully crafted with
diagonal arches supporting a hemispherical roof. The four arches meet
every five meters as the hall extends to form four perpendicular angles.
The floor beneath you is made of smooth, flowing marble. Bright torches
illuminate the hall and a beautiful, polished suit of armour left over
from the Dwarf Gate Wars stands silently watching you. To the north a
grand stairway unfolds itself, while to the west the hall continues with
all sorts of paintings, artifacts, and glorious memorabilia of the
dwarven kings.

[36mEntryway[0;37m
    King Torak has been known to pass judgements based on first
appearances. Apparently Torak had this in mind when he ordered the addition
of this awing entryway to the palace. The entryway consists of a dozen
granite columns lined up on both the left and right hand sides. Columns on
opposite sides are paired together by magnificiently perfect marble arches
that were constructed without a drop of cement to hold them together. The
arches are held together solely by the massive pressure each brick exerts
on the other. Suspended on top of the arches is a domed quartz roof that
casts a bright hue down upon the lavish red carpet that has been rolled out
here. An honor guard post has been set up just south of here to monitor the
entrance of visitors. At the end of the open aired entryway stand large
golden doors leading into the palace. Above the doors a massive seal of the
dwarven kings occupies the remaining space.

    The majestic retreat of King Torak stands proudly just meters away.
Nearly a decade has passed since the original construction of this palace.
King Torak recently invested a heavy chunk of the dwarven treasury towards
a series of upgrades and maintenance projects, resulting in the current
glorious state of the palace. The palace itself has dimensions of a
half-thousand meters squared, and has been constructed in perfect
symmetry. Door sized windows with the curtains drawn line up and down the
dual level, white-washed walls of the palace. Statuettes that depict the
dwarven kings of old stare down at you with pride from atop the roof of the
palace. A majestic entryway greets newcomers to the south with massive
columns of granite crowned by perfect marble arches.

the fortune that is of the dwarves awes even the richest of foreigners.

Two transluscent carvings crafted by the Pyromancer's Guild refract white
light that is so intense it dazzles all those travelling through this

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

east, and reaches its conclusion to the west.

    While dubbed the 'Golden Lane', this slender tunnel-path hardly passes
as anything greater than an alley. And though completely extravagant, gold
is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

    In this residential area of Deep Mine, some homes have been dug
directly into the side of the tunnel. Against the western wall, however, a
large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.

popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

seem to have been given to regular villagers. Miners walk in groups, while
a little lass with short whiskers can be seen carrying home some groceries.
Dwarven children, who have not yet begun education in any of the principle
areas of the town, play in the large tunnel, dodging through the mining
carts. The path south leads to a junction in the Main Way, while to the
north the Main Way continues.

    The Main Way branches in two directions at the Junction. To the west a
smaller tunnel, too tight for mine carts to pass through, meanders through
the mountain, while to the south and north the Main Way continues steadily.
Orange-flamed torches hinged against the western wall light the junction
and its complimentary sign. The sign consists simply of a large four. A
loud explosion is heard a good way off to the west.

[36mThe Route of Pyromancers[0;37m
    A lone lantern, hanging from the ceiling, lights this dim tunnel. The
flame inside the lantern is a sickly green color, obviously the result of
some uncommon chemicals. Some robed dwarves walk through the thin route,
heads huddled together. Upon closer inspection, the robes of these dwarves
appear to have scorch marks all over, yet these dwarves seems to wear their
robes with pride. The tunnel continues to the west, while to the east it
opens up into a junction with the main way. A loud explosion sounds to the
southwest.

[36mOutside the Pyromancer's Guild[0;37m
    The home of the Pyromancers looms before you. While quite an impressive
structure, it is very noticeably not the largest of the guilds in Deep
Mine. Whispers in the street suggest that this maybe the source of some
minor animosity between the Miners and Pyromancers. Of course, it is clear
the village could not maintain its success with only one of the guilds so
the two guilds maintain a level commonly referred to as "Tolerance". The
guild itself is very plain, in sharp contrast to the ornate Mining Guild.
Black or darkly colored curtains cover the windows of the Guild,
emphasizing the secrecy of the pyromancers. Explosions ring and shake the
rock structures yet it still seems very, very sturdy where it lies. A guard
post has been erected outside the guild, however the guards within it do
not appear to be pyromancers. The Pyromancers Guild lies to the south,
while to the north the tunnel leads away from the Guild.

    The home of the Pyromancers looms before you. While quite an impressive
structure, it is very noticeably not the largest of the guilds in Deep
Mine. Whispers in the street suggest that this maybe the source of some
minor animosity between the Miners and Pyromancers. Of course, it is clear
the village could not maintain its success with only one of the guilds so
the two guilds maintain a level commonly referred to as "Tolerance". The
guild itself is very plain, in sharp contrast to the ornate Mining Guild.
Black or darkly colored curtains cover the windows of the Guild,
emphasizing the secrecy of the pyromancers. Explosions ring and shake the
rock structures yet it still seems very, very sturdy where it lies. A guard
post has been erected outside the guild, however the guards within it do
not appear to be pyromancers. The Pyromancers Guild lies to the south,

    The entry hall of the pyromancers guild is left in dim lighting. Flames
of green and red rise out of steel bowls, which must contain strange
chemicals. Emphasizing the dimness of the guild, are the black soot covered
walls. On the western wall some pyromancers have buried and lit the fuse of
a recent creation. Hurriedly, they run behind a make-shift wall so as to
avoid personal danger. After some time it appears as if the explosion
failed, but judging from the singed robes of the dwarves, it is probably a
bad idea to approach the explosives. The hall continues to the south,
deeper into the guild, while the exit of the guild lies to the north.

[36mWithin the Pyromancer's Guild[0;37m
    The entry hall of the pyromancers guild is left in dim lighting. Flames
of green and red rise out of steel bowls, which must contain strange
chemicals. Emphasizing the dimness of the guild, are the black soot covered
walls. On the western wall some pyromancers have buried and lit the fuse of
a recent creation. Hurriedly, they run behind a make-shift wall so as to
avoid personal danger. After some time it appears as if the explosion
failed, but judging from the singed robes of the dwarves, it is probably a
bad idea to approach the explosives. The hall continues to the south,
deeper into the guild, while the exit of the guild lies to the north.

    In the dim-colored light of the guild, pyromancers with sharply pointed
beards, hunch over their racks of chemicals and ground metals attempting to
develop new and more powerful explosives. Piles of metal and barrels of
generic chemicals are developed here for eventual concoction of the proper
brew. The delicacy of the mixing process, putting in the exact ratio of
each chemical, forces these dwarves to completely ignore anything else that
is going on. To the east lies the production center, while to the north
lies the entry hall and initial testing area of the guild.

[36mChemical Mixing Department[0;37m
    In the dim-colored light of the guild, pyromancers with sharply pointed
beards, hunch over their racks of chemicals and ground metals attempting to
develop new and more powerful explosives. Piles of metal and barrels of
generic chemicals are developed here for eventual concoction of the proper
brew. The delicacy of the mixing process, putting in the exact ratio of
each chemical, forces these dwarves to completely ignore anything else that
is going on. To the east lies the production center, while to the north
lies the entry hall and initial testing area of the guild.

    In the dark lighting of the room, it is still quite clear how well the
organization of the production center is handled. Against the eastern wall
are stacks and stacks of individually bundled explosives ready to be moved
over to shipping. Similarly, the southern wall is the place where proper
proportions of chemicals, from the mixing department have been left for
bundling, which takes place in the center of the room. While very few
dwarves work in this area, the meticulousness, with which they perform the
bundling of explosives matched with their caution is deserving of great
respect. It seems that only apprentice producers cause any unsightly
explosions in this room. To the north bundled explosives are shipped, while
to the west lies the chemical mixing department. A staircase on the
southern wall, clearly leads to the master pyromancer's office.

[36mThe Production Center[0;37m
    In the dark lighting of the room, it is still quite clear how well the
organization of the production center is handled. Against the eastern wall
are stacks and stacks of individually bundled explosives ready to be moved
over to shipping. Similarly, the southern wall is the place where proper
proportions of chemicals, from the mixing department have been left for
bundling, which takes place in the center of the room. While very few
dwarves work in this area, the meticulousness, with which they perform the
bundling of explosives matched with their caution is deserving of great
respect. It seems that only apprentice producers cause any unsightly
explosions in this room. To the north bundled explosives are shipped, while
to the west lies the chemical mixing department. A staircase on the
southern wall, clearly leads to the master pyromancer's office.

empty barrels are filled. The northern wall seems to hold explosives for
the region of Deep Mine alone, while the eastern wall indicates a more
international audience. Labels such as Thorbardin, Solace, Northern Ergoth,
and Lok Tath take up sections of the wall. There is even a sign for
Kendermore although barrels no longer sit under it.

    The set up of this department is quite clear. Thousands of empty
barrels are made and placed against the western wall. As production moves
the bundled individual explosives into the department from the south, these
empty barrels are filled. The northern wall seems to hold explosives for
the region of Deep Mine alone, while the eastern wall indicates a more
international audience. Labels such as Thorbardin, Solace, Northern Ergoth,
and Lok Tath take up sections of the wall. There is even a sign for
Kendermore although barrels no longer sit under it.

    In the dark lighting of the room, it is still quite clear how well the

are stacks and stacks of individually bundled explosives ready to be moved
over to shipping. Similarly, the southern wall is the place where proper
proportions of chemicals, from the mixing department have been left for
bundling, which takes place in the center of the room. While very few
dwarves work in this area, the meticulousness, with which they perform the
bundling of explosives matched with their caution is deserving of great
respect. It seems that only apprentice producers cause any unsightly
explosions in this room. To the north bundled explosives are shipped, while
to the west lies the chemical mixing department. A staircase on the
southern wall, clearly leads to the master pyromancer's office.

generic chemicals are developed here for eventual concoction of the proper
brew. The delicacy of the mixing process, putting in the exact ratio of
each chemical, forces these dwarves to completely ignore anything else that
is going on. To the east lies the production center, while to the north
lies the entry hall and initial testing area of the guild.

[36mWithin the Pyromancer's Guild[0;37m
    The entry hall of the pyromancers guild is left in dim lighting. Flames
of green and red rise out of steel bowls, which must contain strange
chemicals. Emphasizing the dimness of the guild, are the black soot covered
walls. On the western wall some pyromancers have buried and lit the fuse of
a recent creation. Hurriedly, they run behind a make-shift wall so as to
avoid personal danger. After some time it appears as if the explosion
failed, but judging from the singed robes of the dwarves, it is probably a
bad idea to approach the explosives. The hall continues to the south,
deeper into the guild, while the exit of the guild lies to the north.

[36mOutside the Pyromancer's Guild[0;37m
    The home of the Pyromancers looms before you. While quite an impressive
structure, it is very noticeably not the largest of the guilds in Deep
Mine. Whispers in the street suggest that this maybe the source of some
minor animosity between the Miners and Pyromancers. Of course, it is clear
the village could not maintain its success with only one of the guilds so
the two guilds maintain a level commonly referred to as "Tolerance". The
guild itself is very plain, in sharp contrast to the ornate Mining Guild.
Black or darkly colored curtains cover the windows of the Guild,
emphasizing the secrecy of the pyromancers. Explosions ring and shake the
rock structures yet it still seems very, very sturdy where it lies. A guard
post has been erected outside the guild, however the guards within it do
not appear to be pyromancers. The Pyromancers Guild lies to the south,
while to the north the tunnel leads away from the Guild.

pleasantly singed robes, the tunnel seems deserted compared to the bustle
of the Main Way. Obviously, the pyromancers are quite secretive about their
craft and art. The tunnel continues to the south here leading right up to
the guild, while the way east leads back toward the Main Way. Explosions,
some soft and some loud are quite commonly heard here.

heads huddled together. Upon closer inspection, the robes of these dwarves
appear to have scorch marks all over, yet these dwarves seems to wear their

and height of four. The tunnel leads to both the north and east. In both

    The facade of the Dwarven Mining Guild is quite impressive. Intricately
carved statues of dwarven miners jut out of the solid rock of which the
guild is cut from. Emeralds, rubies, amethysts, and topazes are encrusted
within the rock, dandifying the already flamboyant display. The tunnel
expands before the guild in almost a large forum. Some miners are visiting
the variety of food stalls set up outside of the guild, taking a quick
break in their days work, while others lean against the building chatting
over new drilling techniques. The guild stands three stories tall, as noted
by the hollowed out rock holes, which serve as windows. To the east lies
the entry hall of the prosperous guild, while the path to the south takes
you away from it.

    The entry hall of the guild is much plainer than the gaudy exterior. In
fact from the look of it, the interior of the guild in general has the more
traditional severity associated with a group of manual labor workers.
Propped against the northern wall is a small chair, perfect for dozing.
Tracks for mining carts lead all the way to the eastern edge of the room,
where there is a circle, allowing the carts to turn around, once unloading
or loading supplies and goods. A few dwarves steadily watch the incoming
and out going carts. The exit of the guild lies directly to the west, while
in the eastern direction the guild continues.

Tracks for mining carts lead all the way to the eastern edge of the room,

    Heaps and heaps of rawly mined materials enter from the mining carts to
the west. Here, they are examined to see if they meet the guilds high
standard of materials for processing. Over twenty desks are set up as
examination stations. When a piece is examined properly, the examiners seem
to pleasantly place them in miniature carts on rollers, which when filled are
moved south into the processing halls. However, in the rare moments when
the raw materials are not up to snuff, a snarl can be seen on the examiners
face as he hurls it against the northern wall. A small pile of the rubble
lies here, ready to be returned to the depths of the mountain.

precious metals, and gems. This area must be the metals area. At the many
processing stations dwarves labor over the extraction of mithril and steel
alloys, as well as natural metals, namely copper and iron. Processed metals
seem to end up against the southern wall. To the west the processing hall
continues, while to the north lies the ore grade determination area.

precious metals is much more meticulously watched. Tiny hammers with
blunted heads are strewn all about. Clearly, the processors of precious
metals do not wish to damage their products at all. To the south lies gem
processing, while to the east lies metal processing. The western wall nests
a spectacular collection of precious metals.

    The precious metals region of the processing hall is loaded with veins
of gold and silver taken directly out of the mines. The processing of the
precious metals is much more meticulously watched. Tiny hammers with
blunted heads are strewn all about. Clearly, the processors of precious
metals do not wish to damage their products at all. To the south lies gem
processing, while to the east lies metal processing. The western wall nests
a spectacular collection of precious metals.

    Gem processing sparkles with the various gems extracted from the mines.
Some of the samples which come in here are still uncut, so a large part of
the gem process is properly cutting the uncut stones. Each of the gem-
processors, who sit at their individual desks, could probably pass as
exceptional jewelers anywhere else in the world. To the east is a large
staircase leading toward the upper level of the guild, while to the north

[36mMining Hall[0;37m
    Unlike the lower levels of the building, and the other guilds in town,
the mining guild has dedicated part of their program to purely theoretical
aspects of mining. As early as seventeen, child dwarves are allowed to
begin training in the arts of mining. All this theoretical training takes
place in the mining halls. Many classrooms branch off of the halls, and
students regularly hustle around. Some old crotchety dwarves, professors,
oversee the hall with bright twinkles in their eyes. To the north the hall
continues, while against the southwestern corner of the hall is a set of
double doors, leading to the Master Miner's Office, as written on a sign.

    Young apprentice miners, some completely hairless, hang around this
area on break from the rigorous duty of intense study. From this room it is
easy to tell the vast difference between the miners and pyromancers. Where
the pyromancers shroud themselves in secrecy, the miners apparently share
any techniques openly with each other. The student lounge has a strangely
diverse crowd. Gnomes, humans, and dwarves all share the room speaking
amiably. Granted the few humans are somewhat outcast, but the fact that
they can work and learn together is a large goodness in these troubled
times. Long sofas are set up around tables where students discuss lessons,
eat, and drink. The students all seem very amiable and excited in their
work. To the east lies the northern end of the mining hall.

    Young apprentice miners, some completely hairless, hang around this
area on break from the rigorous duty of intense study. From this room it is
easy to tell the vast difference between the miners and pyromancers. Where
the pyromancers shroud themselves in secrecy, the miners apparently share
any techniques openly with each other. The student lounge has a strangely
diverse crowd. Gnomes, humans, and dwarves all share the room speaking
amiably. Granted the few humans are somewhat outcast, but the fact that
they can work and learn together is a large goodness in these troubled
times. Long sofas are set up around tables where students discuss lessons,
eat, and drink. The students all seem very amiable and excited in their
work. To the east lies the northern end of the mining hall.

    Unlike the lower levels of the building, and the other guilds in town,
the mining guild has dedicated part of their program to purely theoretical
aspects of mining. As early as seventeen, child dwarves are allowed to
begin training in the arts of mining. All this theoretical training takes
place in the mining halls. Many classrooms branch off of the halls, and
students regularly hustle around. Some old crotchety dwarves, professors,
oversee the hall with bright twinkles in their eyes. To the north the hall
continues, while against the southwestern corner of the hall is a set of
double doors, leading to the Master Miner's Office, as written on a sign.

alloys, as well as natural metals, namely copper and iron. Processed metals
seem to end up against the southern wall. To the west the processing hall
continues, while to the north lies the ore grade determination area.

standard of materials for processing. Over twenty desks are set up as
examination stations. When a piece is examined properly, the examiners seem
to pleasantly place them in miniature carts on rollers, which when filled are
moved south into the processing halls. However, in the rare moments when
the raw materials are not up to snuff, a snarl can be seen on the examiners
face as he hurls it against the northern wall. A small pile of the rubble
lies here, ready to be returned to the depths of the mountain.

fact from the look of it, the interior of the guild in general has the more
traditional severity associated with a group of manual labor workers.
Propped against the northern wall is a small chair, perfect for dozing.
Tracks for mining carts lead all the way to the eastern edge of the room,
where there is a circle, allowing the carts to turn around, once unloading
or loading supplies and goods. A few dwarves steadily watch the incoming
and out going carts. The exit of the guild lies directly to the west, while

    The facade of the Dwarven Mining Guild is quite impressive. Intricately
carved statues of dwarven miners jut out of the solid rock of which the
guild is cut from. Emeralds, rubies, amethysts, and topazes are encrusted
within the rock, dandifying the already flamboyant display. The tunnel
expands before the guild in almost a large forum. Some miners are visiting
the variety of food stalls set up outside of the guild, taking a quick
break in their days work, while others lean against the building chatting
over new drilling techniques. The guild stands three stories tall, as noted
by the hollowed out rock holes, which serve as windows. To the east lies
the entry hall of the prosperous guild, while the path to the south takes
you away from it.

    The Main Way branches in two directions at the Junction. To the west a
smaller tunnel, too tight for mine carts to pass through, meanders through
the mountain, while to the south and north the Main Way continues steadily.
Orange-flamed torches hinged against the western wall light the junction
and its complimentary sign. The sign consists simply of a large four. A
loud explosion is heard a good way off to the west.

    Dancing orange flames from torches mounted near the ceiling, brightly
color this tunnel far below the earth. Being the principle tunnel of the
village, its width and height can easily clear the consciousness of
thousands of tons of rock above. Deep treads in the ground indicate the
path of mining carts, which lie only in the center of the tunnel. The sides
seem to have been given to regular villagers. Miners walk in groups, while
a little lass with short whiskers can be seen carrying home some groceries.
Dwarven children, who have not yet begun education in any of the principle
areas of the town, play in the large tunnel, dodging through the mining
carts. The path south leads to a junction in the Main Way, while to the
north the Main Way continues.

mining carts, which pass by: sometimes relaxedly and sometimes with
reckless abandon. Many dwarves of the village walk on the sides of the
tunnel. From the west interesting smells of smithing and other manufactured
goods waft into the room. To the east and south the Main Way continues.

Surprisingly, the tunnel east, while plenty big enough for the carts, has
no tracks leading in that direction. Villagers are plentiful in the area of
this junction, some chatting wildly with each other, while others sit on
the benches, which have been erected around the junction sign. Torches
bring an abundance of light to this underground tunnel.

popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.

    While dubbed the 'Golden Lane', this slender tunnel-path hardly passes
as anything greater than an alley. And though completely extravagant, gold
is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

    From this vista point a beautiful glow, from the lower levels of the
cavern is readily visible. The rock formations in this area seem to be very
low cut, as even the shortest of dwarves, would easily tower over the
rocks. This leads to an area of heightened interest for the children of
Deep Mine to play. Evidently, the piles of quartz gravel made to look like
castles, were not the original intentions of the gardeners. The path
continues to more peaceful areas of the park, both to the north and south.

    Quite suddenly, the Golden Lane tunnel, which lies through the gate to
the east, has transformed from a dwarf-made structure into this beautiful
natural cavern. High above, stalagtites hang down, yet appear sturdy.
Around the quartz-gravelled path lie large sections of layered, multi-hued
bedrock, complete with naturally eroded holes. To the north a large
stalagmite spikes out of the ground. Embedded on its surface is a small
golden plaque. To the west the garden expands.

cavern is readily visible. The rock formations in this area seem to be very
low cut, as even the shortest of dwarves, would easily tower over the

Deep Mine to play. Evidently, the piles of quartz gravel made to look like
castles, were not the original intentions of the gardeners. The path

dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and

is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large

the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of
the mountain above. Complicated gears and pulleys seem to work together in
an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the

can be heard before they are seen, taking off and landing atop the waters
to the west. The sandy beach leads eastwards and comes to a trailhead,
leading through some verdant rolling hills. The sky is partially cloudy,
and a drizzle of rain can be felt from time to time.

Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name

careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent

distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie

Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for

    Looming over the desert like a giant, you see a city to the north.
Fortified and extremely large, the city seems shrouded in a veil of sand
and heat waves. To the west the road seeps into the endless dunes of which
this road is flanked to both the north and the south. Far to the southeast
lies the fabled city of Port Balifor.

    This large road, composed mostly of dry, dusty dirt, winds its way
across the parched yellow grasses of the plains towards Delphon to the
west, and to a crossroad east of here. The wind carries with it the sounds
of Delphon, a large city whose towering black gates glitter in both
darkness and light. Many travelers pass you by, most heading west towards
the great city of Delphon or beginning the trek to Port Balifor which rests
southeast of here, along the shores of the Khurman Sea. The breeze dies

    Plains expand all around you from this parched, hot dry road. The dirt
of which the road is made is cracked and dry with lack of moisture, and
very few plants other than the occasional cactus dare grow in such a trying
environment. The odd reptile slithers across the path, and there are very
few opportunities for respite along the road. In the distance to the north,
a camp can be seen.

crossroad is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and merchants
alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on
the Blood Sea northeast of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder
that bandits frequent these roads.

down from the Khuri-Khan and Ek-Khan far east of here. The cool breeze from
the sea meets the winds of the hills here in a mild, gusty breeze that

travelers rest in the shade of these large hardwoods. You can see the
sturdy walls of Port Balifor to the south, and the smell of the sea is
strong in the air, the glittering, placid waters of the Bay of Balifor
being visible to the west.  Curving north and to the west, the dusty
road continues along the rolling plains.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot

north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge

    The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace dominates
one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill the
room. A stairway leads up, further into the tree, while another stairway
leads down to the forest below.

    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear

east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
