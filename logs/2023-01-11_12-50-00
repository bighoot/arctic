    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a

registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this

Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    At this point, the road leads to the north through a bog and continues
to the south. The road has been built up with rocks and dirt to maintain a
dry and stable platform. However in some parts this is not the case and the
bog has reclaimed what originally belonged to it. The bog extends out for
quite some distance to the north and east and a bit to the west. Northward,
beyond the bog is a large plain. You see foothills off to the west, south
and northwest directions.

to the point that it seems like it might fall over at any time. In fact,
the only thing that seems to be keeping it standing is the immense pile of
garbage heaped against it. A purple miasma of disgusting odors hangs over
the garbage, ready to suffocate anyone who gets too close. A crude sign on
the wall says that this is the entrance to Agharbardin, as if that wasn't

from here, widening gradually as it rises towards the shadowy ceiling far

an unusual, iridescent coral which casts a warm light that illuminates the
vast cavern surrounding it. Here at its base, the magnificent stalactite
tapers until it is only as wide around as a dwarven waist where it merges
with the limestone island beneath it. A trio of vertical transport shafts
cut through the center of the Life Tree, and the screeching pulleys of the
steam-powered lifts drown out the sounds coming from the nearby docks.

defend their mountain home and keep their mighty kingdom running.

this antechamber, which has been designed to shock and awe visitors. The
ostentatious furnishings amplify the light from the two glow worms napping
on the ceiling until it's almost blinding. The grand hall of this opulent

Short, disheveled, and kind of wretched-looking, this frumpy hylar dwarf
probably never had friends when she was growing up. She always seems to
be mumbling to herself about some fungus or another, talking about topics
that only dwarves steeped in the lore of mycology might have any interest
in. Absently fiddling with a lock of her mold-encrusted hair, she wanders
amongst the toadstools of the garden looking for rare new specimens.

[36mThe Fungal Gardens of Thorbardin[0;37m
    Striking the perfect balance between wildly overgrown and meticulously
cultivated, this garden of mushrooms is a beautiful, psychedelic feast for
the eyes. There is such variety here that it seems like every species of
fungus on the planet--from massive mushrooms to tiny toadstools--is somehow
represented here. The mushrooms grow so thickly, the only way to know where
the garden continues is to try pushing through the wall of fungus.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and sometimes a lovestruck dwarven
couple will step off and wander through one of the archways leading away
from the station. The stone archways and walls are covered with cultivated
mushrooms arranged in beautiful fluorescent patterns. According to a large
plaque on the wall, these are the famed Fungal Gardens of Thorbardin.

tapers until it is only as wide around as a dwarven waist where it merges

cut through the center of the Life Tree, and the screeching pulleys of the

    Built on the limestone island beneath the Life Tree at the center of
Thorbardin, these docks bustle with activity as dwarves from every clan
pass through on the way to the taverns, forges, and shops housed within. A
large winch system sits upon the rocky shore, and thick cables stretch off
across the Urkhan Sea to guide the mechanized ferries over the water. The

    Except for a few snoring gully dwarves napping the among rotting crates
on the east side of the wharf the area is deserted. A purple miasma hangs
over the mound of broken crates, but abruptly stops--almost as if a divine
power erected an invisible wall to block the stench. Contrasting the filthy
east, a broad tunnel opens to the south. A large winch system sits upon
the rocky shore, and thick cables stretch across the Urkhan Sea to guide 
mechanized ferries over the lapping water. The sign here says that ferries 
will take passengers to the Life Tree at the center of the Urkhan Sea.

Mountains, passing between a mountainside and jagged cliffs. To the south,
a steep, but usable path leads down to the road near Tarsis.

    Before you stand two huge brass gates which once guarded the entrance
to Thorbardin. However, a terrible earthquake has caused the passageway
beyond the gates to collapse, sealing off the entrance forever. The giant
gates have fallen off their hinges and lean forlornly against the piles of
rubble. Although the passage into the kingdom is destroyed, the indomitable
mountain known as Cloudseeker still stands, reaching towards the sky. To

    These foothills skirt the eastern edge of the Kharolis Mountains and
provide an excellent place to hunt game. The forests are mainly spruce and
pine, reflecting the cold seasonal climate. There is a large bog to the
south of here and to the northeast, the hills flatten out to the plains of
Dergoth. You can see the snowy peaks on the highest spires of the Kharolis
Mountains to the distant west.

you through the plains of Abanasinia and further on to the port town of
Newport. The plains continue onward south from this point.

    The road continues, now heading to the south. The general terrain seems
to be getting drier and dustier, and there are fewer trees. In addition,
the air seems to be getting somewhat colder. From a nearby hill, a deer
notices you, and bolts into the woods. From here, the road continues to the

to the north and east. The terrain to the east becomes dry and dusty,

some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have

south the bough climbs upward at forty-five degrees, but footholds and

school for budding warriors lies to the west while a clearing on a junction
of boughs can be seen to the east. You have a strange feeling that you are
being watched especially since the thick vallenwood canopy provides
excellent hiding spots for those skilled in being unseen. The trunk of this
massive vallenwood lies back to the north, and can be reached easily by the
footholds and handholds in the bough leading down.

kick sand and water droplets into your face. From the eastern horizon to

Directly across the waters to the north you can barely make out a land mass
and a city, it must be Port o'Call. The sand along the shore becomes more
sparse to the south and a road leads away from the shoreline.

heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the
highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and weeds.
The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire. To the
south, a large mountain range rises through the sky. Most of the mountains
appear jagged and snow-capped.

humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the

[36mThe Tollhouse[0;37m
    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

    The highway runs alongside the west bank of the Vingaard River, below
the high walls of the city itself. The road is heavily rutted as much
traffic passes through the area, and the proximity to the river moistens
the ground. To the west lies a small tollhouse, used in days past to
collect taxes from travellers passing through. Northward the road heads to
the east gate of Vingaard City, and to a ferry crossing the river.

You are at the highest point in the hills of this region, and scanning
around you, you notice a large forest springing up to your east, while to
your west you can see the stone walls of Kalaman. The path leads east to
the lower Estwilde Hills and west across the peaks of the hills.

ranch off to your southeast catches your attention, oddly the fields around
it have dried up, despite the lush, green surrounding region. The path

The fields surrounding the farm have dried up, very odd when considering
the lush hills of the region. You sense there may be some magic at work
there. The main path continues on to the east and west through the hills.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

leaning gently on a walking staff. A small owl is perched on his right
shoulder. The monument to the right looks to be a simple block of granite,
but you sense it is more than that. Stepping closer, you see what appear to
be shatter marks in the otherwise pristine stone. Laying atop the granite
block is what appears to be a mold for the blade and hilt of a sword. The
trees and grass here is severely overgrown, making you wonder when the last
time someone was through this area.

side. And there is no sign of the path needing grooming of any kind. Oddly,
the path doesn't even need repair after you walk along it, as if it is
impossible to tarnish its unremarkable appearance. To the north you see
what look like two small towers made of granite and crystal, each
positioned on either side of the path.

some crystal, some granite, stacked up on the southern edges of the huts.
You begin to realize that those are the small towers you saw earlier. There

It doesn't take long to realize you are atop a cliff, though its edge is
immediately to the north. You cannot see what lies beyond from where you
are, but it looks to drop off suddenly into a small valley. Although you
feel a sense of wariness, you cannot locate the source of your discomfort
until you realize how quiet it is. Pausing momentarily, you realize there
are no signs or sounds of life anywhere nearby. It's as if all the life in
the area has been swept away by some giant hand.

that supposition couldn't have prepared you for what lies within that
valley. Jutting out from beneath the far wall of the valley is the edge of
a building, made from the same stone as the valley walls. You suspect that
it goes much further into the wall, but can't be sure from this distance.
Lying between you and that building is a large field, which looks as though
a war once raged upon it. There are signs of a barricade to your right, a
rock slide to the left, and various pits and traps in between. With sudden
abruptness you realize you are standing on the cliff the young druid
sacrificed his life upon in a final spell to end the Celestial War. Surely
the building hidden under the valley wall must be the Celestial Temple he

decades old battles hangs around you like an oppressive blanket. The ground
beneath your feet is a lifeless color, everything that once grew here
having been crushed into oblivion under soldiers' feet years earlier. As
you shuffle your feet to get a better look around, the dust you kick up
begins to mix with the death in the air. The valley walls block your exit
to the west, but the field of battle continues to the east and north. There

    The crystal block you saw from further away is clearly a monument, but
who originally erected it is a mystery. It appears to be made from solid
red crystal, at least on this side. As you run your hands along the almost
frictionless surface, you discover that the block turns to granite halfway
along each side. Gazing atop the statue, you see the figure of a large
Aurinite knight, his shield and sword resting against on the ground before
him, staring passionless at the valley wall. There looks to be a second
figure standing back-to-back with the Aurinite, but you can't tell from
this side. Nor can you easily go around the statue as it takes up the
entire area immediately to the east.

of equipment, weapons, and armour covered with years of dust and decay
litter the floor. None appear to be in any condition that would make them
valuable, even as souvenirs of the war. Judging from the few tracks you can
still see on the ground and the collection of equipment nearby, the battle
that occurred here obviously spilled over into the areas to the south and

It immediately seems strange to you that this single area was saved from
the Celestial War, but then you notice the faint marks along the ground.
Upon closer examination, they vaguely resemble the marks a broom with stiff
bristles might leave if it were used to sweep the area. It is with some

far from the wall, but it feels unnatural even from this distance. Whatever
force buried the Celestial Temple beneath the valley walls probably
inadvertently caused this rock slide as well. Though you can travel to the
north, west, and south from here, the area immediately to your east has
been cut off by a large pit. Glancing down into the pit you see a

other pieces of equipment badly in need of repairs. But the war remains
seem deliberately sorted into piles of similar items. Weapons have been
sorted from armour and clothing. By the amount of dust that has collected

     The rock slide that spilled into the valley obviously started from
this place, but the disaster looks anything but natural. There are clear
signs from this angle of an explosion, apparently from multiple lightning
bolt strikes given the pattern of them. You find that your attention is
drawn away from the rock slide and to the north, though. A large gate made
of white metal stands before you. A sign hangs on the side of the gate, but
it is in a language you do not understand. Looking through the gate and
seeing what's there, you can't help but feel it reads "Cemetery."

    Waves roll and fall around you, seeking a shore to crash upon. A gentle
ocean current moves the water in a north-south direction here. This area is
often used for shipping as the water is deep and its not too far from land.
In fact, far off to the west you can make out a large land mass, which must
be Southern Ergoth. While off to the south east you can make out what must
be Abanasinia.

curtain separates the civilized from the wild. Brushing aside the numerous

    A fine mist, tiny droplets of rainwater, shuffle to the earth, and run
down the trunks of the trees in tiny rivulets. Placing your hand upon the
wet bark, you can feel warmth spewing out of the wood and into your
fingers. Distant, deep within the core of the wood, a steady, rhythmic beat
vibrates throughout these wooden pillars. Alive and muttering its tales
into the wind, the pulse of these great, wooden giants seems to lead the
forest in a strange primeval dance yet to be understood.

major, and natural, obstacles. Rising from the green grass, erupting in a
shower of stone, a large cliff curls about this clearing. Against the
cliff, a waterfall showers down onto the rocks, and disappears underneath
the fertile land, flowing to realms unknown. Bubbling incessantly, the
crystalline liquid rests momentarily amongst a small patch of reeds hugging
the base of the cliff. In the middle of the clearing, a circular patch of
dead grass has been cleared by intelligent hands, the center being coated
with soot and half-burnt logs. Obviously, this clearing has served as a
camping ground for travellers.

like tiny battle flags, and clumps of snow lie melting in the sun. The air,
once warm, has become dry and cool, your breath shooting out in plumes of
hot steam. Branches droop dangerously over the path, the leaves covered in
a thin layer of frozen dew, and icicles, as sharp as daggers, hang from the
wood, sparkling in the light.

    A mighty oak tree dominates the center of the path. Spreading its
ice-covered branches upwards toward the sky, the long, gnarled fingers hang
over the surrounding area as a mother protecting her children. Scarred and
colored a fading brown, the trunk has become firmly embedded in the forest
floor over the last several hundred years. Walking past it, stiff blades of
frozen grass crumble and shatter beneath your feet, the freezing
temperatures beginning to numb your toes. In the distance, the sobs of a
crying female can be heard. Past these sounds, to the north, the path
allows you to move closer to the mountains.

    Stabbing the clear skies, the peaks of the mountains stretch upwards to
the heavens. A ring of clouds encircles the very pinnacle, hugging the cold
rock and protecting the great sheets of ice and snow that blanket the solid
cliffs. Within the clouds, strange shapes flit and soar about, breaking
away from the froth, and, then, meld and mold themselves into contorted
shapes, eventually merging back into their snow-filled homes and
disappearing from sight.

    The trees, the foliage, sparkle in the light, covered in a thin layer
of frost. Seemingly painted on, the frozen dew attaches itself to the oak
trees, swirling patterns turning the hard wood into a natural canvas.
Across the ground, just outside the trail, tiny footprints have been left
behind, and lead in a variety of directions, twisting through the woods. At
your feet, thin ruts are the only signs of passing carts, and they become
deeper as the path continues to the north. Oddly, the wheel tracks only
begin at this point, and, even though the earth has been frozen by the
mountain's frigid winds, the imprints are deeply cut into the black soil.
To the west, hidden behind a tree leaning to one side, its roots being
slowly, tortuously ripped from the forest floor, a pile of brush lies
covered with clumps of snow.

out into the sea.

    Great chunks of ice and snow collapse into the swampy waters, sliding
down a small slope to the north and finally rolling into the river. Here,
the current has increased in strength, and scummy water pulls the boat
gently toward the south. In that direction, just inside a thick line of
trees hanging over the tepid water, great pillars of precious metals rise
from the forest floor and climb great heights. From within, floating
outward, the music of a flute can be heard hovering above the river. Before
you, the muddy water of the River of The Dead rushes about in frenzied
confusion. Twirling about, a great whirlpool has been created near the
southern bank, sucking in the forest debris scattered on the dull and oily
surface of this mountain stream.

[36mA Lush Basin[0;37m
    The verdant forest buzzes with wildlife activity. Several small, brown
squirrels race across the ground in competition over fallen walnuts, each
scrambling in erratic patterns. A massive oak tree is sprawled across the
forest floor, propped at an awkward angle by the unlucky trees that caught
its fall. Massive roots of the fallen giant are exposed where its mangled
base has been ripped from the dark, rich earth. The wide trunk and gentle
incline of this felled tree make it quite easy to climb. A tall ridge rises
to the west that seems impossible to scale and the forest is too thick to
traverse to the north. The lush forest basin continues to the east and
south.

[36mNear a Swift Stream[0;37m
    Water splashes and gurgles as a small stream forms tiny rapids over
rounded rocks that break the water's surface. The spring water is
refreshingly cool and clear, showing a depth of about ten feet. The muddy
western bank is too steep and slick to climb, but there appears to be a
better crossing point to the south. A large oak tree extends at an awkward
angle over the waters edge, most of its mass hanging well over the bubbling
stream. Green ivy grows up the oak's surface, and many years of erosion
have exposed the ancient tree's roots. The woods thicken to the east, and
the muddy bank parallels the stream to the north and south.

Loud splashes from a large school of fish on a feeding frenzy adds to the
buzz of non-stop bird chatter in the tall canopied trees. A large fallen
tree with huge knots and torn limbs bridges the two muddy banks and
provides easy crossing to the west. Partially hidden by tall reeds lies a
body pinned under the log bridging the creek. The muddy banks of the cold
stream are covered in animal tracks, indicating a favorite watering spot
for deer. Several dark, fist-sized holes are scattered along the banks,
likely home to snakes and other small creatures.

    A narrow path is beaten into the forest floor heading through the thick
foliage to the west. The red splatter of blood is splashed across the base
of a tree along the path; only the battered skull of a deer remains. A
small winding river is fed by a small waterfall to the east and winds to
the northwest. The tall trees almost completely block out the sky, but the
trail of dark smoke can be seen through small gaps in the canopy to the
southwest. To the west, several deer flee to the north, running from some
unseen danger.

foliage to the west. The red splatter of blood is splashed across the base
of a tree along the path; only the battered skull of a deer remains. A
small winding river is fed by a small waterfall to the east and winds to
the northwest. The tall trees almost completely block out the sky, but the
trail of dark smoke can be seen through small gaps in the canopy to the
southwest. To the west, several deer flee to the north, running from some
unseen danger.

    Tall, leaf-covered trees canopy the lush green forest floor. Small
rocks and stones jut from the green earth, easily able to trip someone not
wary of their surroundings. Bent grass and broken branches upon the thick
foliage indicate something large has passed through this area. A patch of
colorful, spotted mushrooms grows in the shade of a sprawling oak. An arrow
is imbedded in the brown trunk,its tip just at neck height. Thick forest
continues to the north, and the hint of smoke may be seen in the skyline to

[36mSkirting the Verdant Forest[0;37m
    Tall, leaf-covered trees canopy the lush green forest floor. Small
rocks and stones jut from the green earth, easily able to trip someone not
wary of their surroundings. Bent grass and broken branches upon the thick
foliage indicate something large has passed through this area. A patch of
colorful, spotted mushrooms grows in the shade of a sprawling oak. An arrow
is imbedded in the brown trunk,its tip just at neck height. Thick forest
continues to the north, and the hint of smoke may be seen in the skyline to
the west.

[36mA Corner of the Forest[0;37m
    The forest is a vibrant symphony of sounds; birds' melodious calls,
buzzing insects, and the light rustling of leaves all blend together in
harmony. Tall trees block out most of the sky here, but enough sunlight
finds its way down through the canopy during the day to allow the growth of
many shrubs and bushes beneath their branches. They grow especially thick
towards the south and west, appearing to block further travel in either
direction. Underfoot is a vast assortment of creeping vines, dry leaves,
fallen branches, and lost twigs of all sizes and shapes. As peaceful as
this place seems, the distinctive smell of something burning wafts along
the breeze and is accompanied by a vague sense of something darker lurking
nearby.

[36mA Corner of the Forest[0;37m
    The forest is a vibrant symphony of sounds; birds' melodious calls,
buzzing insects, and the light rustling of leaves all blend together in
harmony. Tall trees block out most of the sky here, but enough sunlight
finds its way down through the canopy during the day to allow the growth of
many shrubs and bushes beneath their branches. They grow especially thick
towards the south and west, appearing to block further travel in either
direction. Underfoot is a vast assortment of creeping vines, dry leaves,
fallen branches, and lost twigs of all sizes and shapes. As peaceful as
this place seems, the distinctive smell of something burning wafts along
the breeze and is accompanied by a vague sense of something darker lurking
nearby.

long branches and whole saplings loosely grouped together, bright orange
flames dancing along their lengths. Heavy feet have carved a path here,
encircling the fire and heading off in all directions.

    What was once a magnificent monolith has collapsed in a southerly
direction and now lies broken into several pieces, crumbling with age. The
severed ends of the pillar are rough and gradually breaking away but the
face of the stone is still surprisingly smooth and polished, having
weathered the passage of time remarkably well. The formerly utmost section
has fallen such that it is propped up at one end by an ancient oak,
providing some measure of shelter beneath it. The rest of the pieces all
still lay roughly where they originally fell, preserving some semblance of
the pillar's original appearance albeit in a horizontal fashion. Slightly
northward of the pillar's broken base lie the vague remains of a demolished
stone wall, its fractured segments mostly buried beneath the forest floor.

    A sleek stone barrier rises roughly ten feet above the ground here: the
only stable remains of an ancient enclosure that once fortified the entire
area where the troll's camp now resides. The rest of the broken fragments
leave an easily followed trail marking out the vague skeleton of the
crumbled wall. Apparently it once ran east-to-west where trees now stand to
the north before forming a corner towards the northwest and then running
deep into the impassible foliage to the south. But that was long ago and
the forest has since reclaimed the area, save for the broad stretch of wall
to the west. Clenching tree roots, crawling underbrush and a loose mat of
dirt and decayed leaves have covered most of the toppled remains and
threaten to erase even a trace of the wall's existence in time to come.

the north before forming a corner towards the northwest and then running

the forest has since reclaimed the area, save for the broad stretch of wall

    The hidden chamber has a circular base of cobblestone, with slick
vaulted walls that arch overhead. A large ring of pitch black round stone
forms a wide perimeter of about six paces in the center of the room, where
the faint outlines of a massive pentagram lie in its center. Every thing in
the room, from floor to the sparse furnishings to the domed ceiling has
been charred black from exposure to tremendous amounts of heat over a long
period of time. Near the charred door to the east lay a scorched set of
bones several of the smaller pieces imbedded into the wall from some
powerful force.

[36mAn Ancient Barricade[0;37m
    A sleek stone barrier rises roughly ten feet above the ground here: the
only stable remains of an ancient enclosure that once fortified the entire
area where the troll's camp now resides. The rest of the broken fragments
leave an easily followed trail marking out the vague skeleton of the
crumbled wall. Apparently it once ran east-to-west where trees now stand to
the north before forming a corner towards the northwest and then running
deep into the impassible foliage to the south. But that was long ago and
the forest has since reclaimed the area, save for the broad stretch of wall
to the west. Clenching tree roots, crawling underbrush and a loose mat of
dirt and decayed leaves have covered most of the toppled remains and
threaten to erase even a trace of the wall's existence in time to come.

weathered the passage of time remarkably well. The formerly utmost section
has fallen such that it is propped up at one end by an ancient oak,
providing some measure of shelter beneath it. The rest of the pieces all
still lay roughly where they originally fell, preserving some semblance of
the pillar's original appearance albeit in a horizontal fashion. Slightly

stone wall, its fractured segments mostly buried beneath the forest floor.

    The roof of the cave yawns widely overhead and to the sides, easily
able to accommodate several of even the tallest trolls side-by-side. The
walls themselves are amazingly smooth to the touch, marking them as clearly
artificial and just as clearly beyond the ability of any troll to sculpt.
There are no clues as to who created this place or even how long it has
been here, but considering all the filth the trolls have left behind it's
unlikely they would want to reclaim it. Aside from the debris littering the
ground absolutely no objects or decorations at all can be found, implying
very plain taste in both its original and current owners. The cave extends
downward into blackness, and exits back west towards the campfire.

    The roof of the cave yawns widely overhead and to the sides, easily
able to accommodate several of even the tallest trolls side-by-side. The
walls themselves are amazingly smooth to the touch, marking them as clearly
artificial and just as clearly beyond the ability of any troll to sculpt.
There are no clues as to who created this place or even how long it has
been here, but considering all the filth the trolls have left behind it's
unlikely they would want to reclaim it. Aside from the debris littering the
ground absolutely no objects or decorations at all can be found, implying
very plain taste in both its original and current owners. The cave extends
downward into blackness, and exits back west towards the campfire.

[36mA Large Cave Opening[0;37m
    The roof of the cave yawns widely overhead and to the sides, easily
able to accommodate several of even the tallest trolls side-by-side. The
walls themselves are amazingly smooth to the touch, marking them as clearly
artificial and just as clearly beyond the ability of any troll to sculpt.
There are no clues as to who created this place or even how long it has
been here, but considering all the filth the trolls have left behind it's
unlikely they would want to reclaim it. Aside from the debris littering the
ground absolutely no objects or decorations at all can be found, implying
very plain taste in both its original and current owners. The cave extends
downward into blackness, and exits back west towards the campfire.

    The forest has been greatly thinned here, providing a clear view of the
sky as well as the forest floor. Severed trunks and deep pits where tall
trees once stood litter the ground. At the center of the devastation lies a
crude pit, blackened and charred from heavy use. Within it lie dozens of
long branches and whole saplings loosely grouped together, bright orange
flames dancing along their lengths. Heavy feet have carved a path here,
encircling the fire and heading off in all directions.

[36mA Topped Pillar[0;37m
    What was once a magnificent monolith has collapsed in a southerly
direction and now lies broken into several pieces, crumbling with age. The
severed ends of the pillar are rough and gradually breaking away but the
face of the stone is still surprisingly smooth and polished, having
weathered the passage of time remarkably well. The formerly utmost section
has fallen such that it is propped up at one end by an ancient oak,
providing some measure of shelter beneath it. The rest of the pieces all
still lay roughly where they originally fell, preserving some semblance of
the pillar's original appearance albeit in a horizontal fashion. Slightly
northward of the pillar's broken base lie the vague remains of a demolished
stone wall, its fractured segments mostly buried beneath the forest floor.

[36mA Ruined Dwelling[0;37m
    Almost completely hidden by the thick stands of trees, the remnants of
a strange building stand here. Only the far western wall is still intact,
dull grey in color and extraordinarily smooth to the touch. It is certainly
made of stone but no seams are visible at the wall corners or between the
floor and ceiling, as if the stone was poured in molten form to create the
simple building all at once. Time has not treated the brittle material
well, though, and now parts of the southern wall, most of the northern
wall, and a large portion of the proper entrance to the east have broken
off and crumbled into the dirt. All but a fraction of the ceiling has caved
in as well, and now serves as a second layer of flooring for the building
rather than a way of keeping out the elements.

    Almost completely hidden by the thick stands of trees, the remnants of
a strange building stand here. Only the far western wall is still intact,
dull grey in color and extraordinarily smooth to the touch. It is certainly
made of stone but no seams are visible at the wall corners or between the
floor and ceiling, as if the stone was poured in molten form to create the
simple building all at once. Time has not treated the brittle material
well, though, and now parts of the southern wall, most of the northern
wall, and a large portion of the proper entrance to the east have broken
off and crumbled into the dirt. All but a fraction of the ceiling has caved
in as well, and now serves as a second layer of flooring for the building
rather than a way of keeping out the elements.

    The walls, floor, and even the towering ceiling of this enormous cave
have all been painted a dauntingly dark-red color, very reminiscent of
dried blood. Leaping and dancing across the bloodied walls are many twisted
shadows, thrown by a small fire crackling under a bubbling pot. A pile of
bones and many bodies are scattered throughout the cave, giving the
distinct impression that this place is used to make bloody sacrifices as a
part of some dark spiritual rite. The carnage this all brings to mind
nearly obfuscates the construction of the cave, which has been meticulously
engineered to create a perfectly cylindrical tunnel and is also amazingly
well polished. The floor of the cave drops away sharply to the south,
leading downwards into the unknown while the cavern exits towards a large
campfire to the north or west into the forest.

[36mA Crimson Cave[0;37m
    The walls, floor, and even the towering ceiling of this enormous cave
have all been painted a dauntingly dark-red color, very reminiscent of
dried blood. Leaping and dancing across the bloodied walls are many twisted
shadows, thrown by a small fire crackling under a bubbling pot. A pile of
bones and many bodies are scattered throughout the cave, giving the
distinct impression that this place is used to make bloody sacrifices as a
part of some dark spiritual rite. The carnage this all brings to mind
nearly obfuscates the construction of the cave, which has been meticulously
engineered to create a perfectly cylindrical tunnel and is also amazingly
well polished. The floor of the cave drops away sharply to the south,
leading downwards into the unknown while the cavern exits towards a large
campfire to the north or west into the forest.

    Almost completely hidden by the thick stands of trees, the remnants of
a strange building stand here. Only the far western wall is still intact,
dull grey in color and extraordinarily smooth to the touch. It is certainly
made of stone but no seams are visible at the wall corners or between the
floor and ceiling, as if the stone was poured in molten form to create the
simple building all at once. Time has not treated the brittle material
well, though, and now parts of the southern wall, most of the northern
wall, and a large portion of the proper entrance to the east have broken
off and crumbled into the dirt. All but a fraction of the ceiling has caved
in as well, and now serves as a second layer of flooring for the building
rather than a way of keeping out the elements.

leave an easily followed trail marking out the vague skeleton of the
crumbled wall. Apparently it once ran east-to-west where trees now stand to
the north before forming a corner towards the northwest and then running
deep into the impassible foliage to the south. But that was long ago and
the forest has since reclaimed the area, save for the broad stretch of wall
to the west. Clenching tree roots, crawling underbrush and a loose mat of
dirt and decayed leaves have covered most of the toppled remains and
threaten to erase even a trace of the wall's existence in time to come.

    The roof of the cave yawns widely overhead and to the sides, easily
able to accommodate several of even the tallest trolls side-by-side. The
walls themselves are amazingly smooth to the touch, marking them as clearly
artificial and just as clearly beyond the ability of any troll to sculpt.
There are no clues as to who created this place or even how long it has
been here, but considering all the filth the trolls have left behind it's
unlikely they would want to reclaim it. Aside from the debris littering the
ground absolutely no objects or decorations at all can be found, implying
very plain taste in both its original and current owners. The cave extends
downward into blackness, and exits back west towards the campfire.

    The unnatural cave abruptly halts its previous course and changes
direction, heading sharply south one way and steeply upward out the other.
The polished walls are damp with moisture and a shallow, trough-like puddle
stretches along the entire central dip in the cylindrical tunnel's floor.
The pool has a very thick consistency and generates a sickening stench,
revealing it as a mixture of water, half-eaten meals, and much more that
has passed beyond the point of recognition. Fortunately, the cavern's wide,
unobstructed passages provide a steady flow of fresh air to abate the odor.
Unfortunately however, the breeze does nothing to help the disgusting and
slimy feel of sloshing through the puddle.

[36mThe Heart of the Den[0;37m
    This is the core of the troll community, buried deep under the earth to
protect the fragile young trolls from any outside threats. The area is
about as "homey" as one would expect for a colony of trolls. The puddle of
filth that runs through the entire cavern's floor is even more grotesque in
this section of the tunnel, with several carcasses meant to serve as food
for the young soaking in the dark ichor. Heaps of fur and clothing stripped
from the bodies are spread along the sides of the cylindrical tunnel, well
above the edges of the cesspool that fills the floor's central dip. Other
colonies have also made their home here: that of carrion worms, grubs and
other vile pests that live amongst the corpses. The smell of rotting and
decayed flesh is nearly unbearable despite the appreciable ventilation of
the cavern's wide tunnels. Sharply changing course once again the tunnel
leads north one way and west through the other, both into darkness.

    This portion of the cave is filled with bones and rotting remains, the
acrid stench of which is nearly overwhelming. Apparently everything the
trolls kill are eventually dragged or dropped into this room after they're
finished with the bodies. Several troll bones and corpses also lie here -
perhaps the victims of battle - though no effort has been made to arrange
or identify them. A long, vile puddle runs along the dip of the cylindrical
tunnel, compounding the smell and soaking the bodies to increase the rate
of decay. The tunnel climbs steeply to the north and bends eastward.

[36mThe Burial Ground[0;37m
    This portion of the cave is filled with bones and rotting remains, the
acrid stench of which is nearly overwhelming. Apparently everything the
trolls kill are eventually dragged or dropped into this room after they're
finished with the bodies. Several troll bones and corpses also lie here -
perhaps the victims of battle - though no effort has been made to arrange
or identify them. A long, vile puddle runs along the dip of the cylindrical
tunnel, compounding the smell and soaking the bodies to increase the rate
of decay. The tunnel climbs steeply to the north and bends eastward.

    This is the core of the troll community, buried deep under the earth to
protect the fragile young trolls from any outside threats. The area is
about as "homey" as one would expect for a colony of trolls. The puddle of
filth that runs through the entire cavern's floor is even more grotesque in
this section of the tunnel, with several carcasses meant to serve as food
for the young soaking in the dark ichor. Heaps of fur and clothing stripped
from the bodies are spread along the sides of the cylindrical tunnel, well
above the edges of the cesspool that fills the floor's central dip. Other
colonies have also made their home here: that of carrion worms, grubs and
other vile pests that live amongst the corpses. The smell of rotting and
decayed flesh is nearly unbearable despite the appreciable ventilation of
the cavern's wide tunnels. Sharply changing course once again the tunnel
leads north one way and west through the other, both into darkness.

    This is the core of the troll community, buried deep under the earth to
protect the fragile young trolls from any outside threats. The area is
about as "homey" as one would expect for a colony of trolls. The puddle of
filth that runs through the entire cavern's floor is even more grotesque in
this section of the tunnel, with several carcasses meant to serve as food
for the young soaking in the dark ichor. Heaps of fur and clothing stripped
from the bodies are spread along the sides of the cylindrical tunnel, well
above the edges of the cesspool that fills the floor's central dip. Other
colonies have also made their home here: that of carrion worms, grubs and
other vile pests that live amongst the corpses. The smell of rotting and
decayed flesh is nearly unbearable despite the appreciable ventilation of
the cavern's wide tunnels. Sharply changing course once again the tunnel
leads north one way and west through the other, both into darkness.

[36mThe Heart of the Den[0;37m
    This is the core of the troll community, buried deep under the earth to
protect the fragile young trolls from any outside threats. The area is
about as "homey" as one would expect for a colony of trolls. The puddle of
filth that runs through the entire cavern's floor is even more grotesque in
this section of the tunnel, with several carcasses meant to serve as food
for the young soaking in the dark ichor. Heaps of fur and clothing stripped
from the bodies are spread along the sides of the cylindrical tunnel, well
above the edges of the cesspool that fills the floor's central dip. Other
colonies have also made their home here: that of carrion worms, grubs and
other vile pests that live amongst the corpses. The smell of rotting and
decayed flesh is nearly unbearable despite the appreciable ventilation of
the cavern's wide tunnels. Sharply changing course once again the tunnel
leads north one way and west through the other, both into darkness.

[36mNorthern Avenue[0;37m
    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

[36mA Small Side Street[0;37m
    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace dominates
one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill the
room. A stairway leads up, further into the tree, while another stairway
leads down to the forest below.
