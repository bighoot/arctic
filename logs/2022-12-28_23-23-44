[36mThe Burrow[0;37m
    A small humble inn, the Burrow offers a comfortable bed and even a
hearty meal to its patrons. A fire burns brightly inside a fireplace carved
straight out of the mountain; its shaft leading all the way out. Long
tables with patrons enjoying dinner and a comfortable sofa at the eastern
end of the room are the primary elements of furniture. A door on the
western end of the burrow must lead to the private customer rooms. On the
northern wall of the Burrow is a small stage, where some musicians and
entertainers try to earn their way to a bed. Various tables have been set
up around the stage, but the customers here are very quiet and pleasant,
compared to the more raucous group above. A stairway to Binar's Bar is up
against the southern wall; this is the only direction out of the inn.

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

    Fabulous aromas assault the senses from all sides of this compact
kitchen. Over the fire-pit a huge pig is roasting slowly, while at the
stove bread bakes to a fine golden brown. A bookshelf on the southern wall
holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a
priest of Reorx. A window set on the northern wall is open, in the
unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,
while the backdoor of the Burrow is framed near the window.

the young dwarves's bachelorhood; no respectable dwarven woman would be
taking care of this group of swine and filth. A small fire burns in the

Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

Every character in Arctic has its own set of abilities. The basic
abilities are strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution and
charisma.  There are also hidden abilities.

Arctic uses a 0..28 scale for basic ability scores for characters. New
players all have mundane ability scores at level 1. You will receive your
real ability scores at level 2, however nothing short of divine
intervention will reveal your real ability scores until you reach level 3
(which gods are forbidden to divulge). At level 3, you may find your
abilities with a legend lore scroll, potion of knowledge or other similar
comparable item, for sale in most large cities.

Strength determines how hard you hit, how much weight you can carry and
what weapons you can wield.

Intelligence helps you advance in learning spells and skills faster, and
intelligent casters also find that memorizing spells takes less time.

Wisdom also affects how your skills progress. Additionally, some spell
casters will gain increased casting ability with higher wisdom.

Dexterity helps you to avoid the melee attacks. Many skills also require
sleight of hand.

Constitution is responsible for your maximum hit points. The more
constitution you have the higher your hit points will be.

A character's Charisma score is a measure of the level of awe and respect
that character naturally inspires in others. This is not based solely on
physical appearance but is also a measure of a character's persona and
imposing nature. Charisma has an impact on a character's interaction with
both mortal and extraplanar beings, and will affect spells and powers that
deal with the divine or elemental planes. Additionally, skills and spells
that rely on intimidating or inspiring others will be affected by this score.

Hidden abilities cover almost anything that makes your character different
from the others, but only the Gods know how it works exactly. These
abilities can be affected by items, spells, the age of your character
and other factors.

this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the

THE BASH SKILL
Format: BASH <PLAYER|MOBILE>

It's quite simple - knock the enemy to the ground. Though a bash will
prevent you from performing any activities for a small period, the
advantages could well outweigh the delay. For example, a fallen enemy
will be unable to perform many actions, including casting spells.

While it is possible to bash without a shield, the chances of success are
significantly reduced. Further, using bash with a low quality shield will
cause less damage at impact than higher qualities. Use the INSPECT command
to survey the quality of your shield.

An unsuccessful attempt to bash will have the opposite effect than desired,
with the basher missing wildly and ending up on the ground.

NOTE: Mobs are not subject to exactly the same rules as players.

NOTE: Some (not all) things that affect your chance to land a bash:
-Your dexterity
-Your target's dexterity
-Your skill at bashing
-Your target's ability to withstand a bash through item bonuses or spells.

Details:
- Offensive skill which attempts to bash a target, putting them in a
  sitting position, causing damage, and impairing their ability to act
  temporarily.
- The warrior's strength, along with the quality and weight of their
  shield, affect bash damage.
- Missed bashes will cause the basher to wind up on the ground and waiting
  instead.

    Mud puddles line a path, leading directly into the back of a giant
dragon's mouth. A small opening is easily visible between the skull and the
mandible. The mud here has a strange sweet smell that is surprisingly
pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem
terrifyingly bigger than the ones seen above. Most of the hoofprints seem
to be leading east, where the mud gets thicker.

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

    Viscous streams of the sweet-smelling, orange-tan mud spills forth from
an unseen source above. The result is an absolutely absurd amount of mud in

have spent their time recuperating energy. The path to the west looks a

    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area

[36mA Hot, Muddy Spring[0;37m
    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area
below.

[36mA Hot, Muddy Spring[0;37m
    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area
below.

    Viscous streams of the sweet-smelling, orange-tan mud spills forth from
an unseen source above. The result is an absolutely absurd amount of mud in
this room. Looking down, huge body prints have been cast where armaboros
have spent their time recuperating energy. The path to the west looks a
little bit easier to move in, since, here, you are forced to swim.

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem

to be leading east, where the mud gets thicker.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural
wonderland.

Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the

varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

    The trail continues to the east and west, along the edge of the Forest
of Silvanesti. The path weaves through the trees, now thicker from the
looming forests to the south. Brilliant light-rays shine down from the
dense canopy above the forest floor. Sparse foliage and a lack of downed
trees along the trail indicate this path sees some amount of traffic.
Traveling here seems peaceful and unencumbered.

road west is completely useless now, having been destroyed during the

the Plains of Dust. It is now a relic that serves as a harsh reminder that
even the mightiest can fall. A rocky trail from the north leads down the
hill, following King's Road at its base. An unfragmented section of the

the forests of Silvanesti, however that road is free of wagon tracks and

    Cool winds cut through your clothing, sending chills through your body
and adding insult to injury as they carry with them stinging grains of
reddish sand. This barren path cuts through the center of the Plains of
Dust, conjoining East Road and King's Road. Though not a road, the
semi-frozen ground and lack of vegetation makes for a more than adequate
trail. Laid with trailmarkers, the path through the plains is clear, though
merchants have been known to get disoriented and wander off during
particularly bad dust storms.

LIBRARY OF KHRYSTAN
============

BACKGROUND:

The ancient library of Khrystan was once a rival in grandeur to the library
of Palanthas, and a center of academic nobility. This all changed when the
edict of thought control was issued in 6 PC by the Kingpriest Beldinas of
Istar which decreed that all written texts must be written to favor Paladine
and the gods of good, and all others be destroyed. In order to protect the
library the Aesthetics of Gilean and their guardians fought off all intruders,
sealed the library, and destroyed the library's catalogue. The library is
rumored to still contain centuries of wisdom, if one could find their way in.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The library can be explored by anyone who is able to find it, though if one
were to challenge the Aesthetics or their guardians they will need to be of
mid-level (17+), and to solve some of the mysteries within the library may
take a group of adventurers (20-25).

LOCATION:

The location of the library was lost to all but the Aesthetics,  but it is
rumored to be hidden within the city of Tarsis.

torches in wall sconces which do not provide enough light. Some dust and
debris has collected in the corners of the room which suggests it is not
regularly looked after. The sturdy stone walls of this chamber are nearly
unmarred except for a few striations slightly visible in the shadows of
torchlight.

The corpse of an elder armaboro arrives from the south.
[36mA Small Chapel[0;37m
    The chapel is dedicated to the god Gilean. Stone walls reach high to
the arched ceiling. Several rows of plain wooden pews have been neatly
arranged facing a simple altar beneath the apse. On top of the altar sits a
scale of balance resting on an open book. The entryway to the south leads
to an antechamber.

LIBRARY OF KHRYSTAN
============

BACKGROUND:

The ancient library of Khrystan was once a rival in grandeur to the library
of Palanthas, and a center of academic nobility. This all changed when the
edict of thought control was issued in 6 PC by the Kingpriest Beldinas of
Istar which decreed that all written texts must be written to favor Paladine
and the gods of good, and all others be destroyed. In order to protect the
library the Aesthetics of Gilean and their guardians fought off all intruders,
sealed the library, and destroyed the library's catalogue. The library is
rumored to still contain centuries of wisdom, if one could find their way in.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The library can be explored by anyone who is able to find it, though if one
were to challenge the Aesthetics or their guardians they will need to be of
mid-level (17+), and to solve some of the mysteries within the library may
take a group of adventurers (20-25).

LOCATION:

The location of the library was lost to all but the Aesthetics,  but it is
rumored to be hidden within the city of Tarsis.

[36mA Small Chapel[0;37m
    The chapel is dedicated to the god Gilean. Stone walls reach high to
the arched ceiling. Several rows of plain wooden pews have been neatly
arranged facing a simple altar beneath the apse. On top of the altar sits a
scale of balance resting on an open book. The entryway to the south leads
to an antechamber.

[36mAn Unadorned Antechamber[0;37m
    This dimly lit and unadorned chamber acts as the entryway to a simple
chapel to the north. The chamber is scarce of anything, save but a few
torches in wall sconces which do not provide enough light. Some dust and
debris has collected in the corners of the room which suggests it is not
regularly looked after. The sturdy stone walls of this chamber are nearly
unmarred except for a few striations slightly visible in the shadows of
torchlight.

withstood the test of time very well, though how long it has been here is
hard to say. The winding stairs continue up to a small metal hatch above,
and descends to the west.

bookshelves after the hard work of the Aesthetics. There are four
bookshelves in this row, two lower and two upper. The shelves appear to go
on forever, housing hundreds of books. Far above the highest shelves the
ceiling appears to have wide skylights which have been covered with earth
and rock. There is an eerie silence about this place, and each footstep
echoes almost eternally.

    Rows of bookshelves lead in all directions, with some shelves far out
of reach. The lower shelves within reach appear to be stacked with hundreds
of books. The bookshelves swallow the surrounding light, making it
difficult to make out any titles without searching the shelves more
closely. The Aesthetics have put considerable work into cleaning this space
and organizing the bookshelves.

    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

[36mBefore a Humble Inn[0;37m
    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

[36mJunction One[0;37m
    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

torches above the sign. Many of the villagers walk about here. A group of
merchants mills around, having recently arrived from the main elevator
shaft, which lies directly to the west. To the north and south the Main Way
continues. The Deep Mine Main Shaft is the clear way back to the mountain
surface.

[36mThe Entrance to Deep Mine[0;37m
    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of
the mountain above. Complicated gears and pulleys seem to work together in
an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their

much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western

    A large tree rooted to the side of the trail threatens to tumble down
the mountain side into the ogre village below. The trail here, while
mountainous, is relatively flat and straight, but to the north it clearly
becomes a much more difficult journey. Of course, the trail also leads east
toward the gates of the dwarven keep.

Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both

    King's Road was once a grand elevated highway which was supported
by large pillars thirty feet in the air running on pillars for 600 miles
from Thon-Thalas in the east to Purstal in the west. Originally molded from
stone by House Mason of the Silvanesti Elves as a means to travel from
Silvanesti, through the Plains of Dust and into Qualinesti, it was widely
used by merchants and travelers, however during the Cataclysm the highway
collapsed near Purstal and lies in ruins further west of that point.

    King's Road runs parallel to the Khaldat river, too high and too

    This once grand and beautifully crafted highway has been ravaged by the

across what is now known as the Plains of Dust, leading all the way to
Sancrist. There is, however, little proof of King's Road extending beyond
this point, as anything that may lie further west is buried beneath the

the roads leading to her. Very few plants have the will or tenacity to try
growing on these rocky soils, and the slightest green of a stubborn moss is
a sight for sore eyes.

    The fortified walls of Tarsis rise up from the Plains of Dust like
mighty cliffs, defiant against the cold, harsh winds, and dwarfed only by
the fifty foot towers that nearly encircle the city. The ancient city walls
have withstood the tests of time, including the Cataclysm in all of its
fiery glory. Once called Tarsis the Beautiful, the Lordcity was a bustling
sea port, whose rich commerce brought sustainability and prosperity to the
land. The city now looks as desolate as the plains that surround it.
Tempestuous winds assail the walls with endless specks of sand, causing
minimal damage to the walls, but serving as a constant reminder that
nothing can survive forever in these wastelands.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    Elegantly carved columns of white lie on either side of the arched
entryway. A massive chamber filled with endless rows of bookshelves lies to
the east beyond the archway. Reflective tiles of marble shine with a luster
rarely found. Though the chamber has been recently cleaned, cobwebs still
dangle from the ceiling trim and other hard to reach places. A winding
staircase can be seen to the west, while a sprawling library opens up to
the east.

bookshelves on the floor below. Every square inch of the walls are covered
in bookshelves, upon which lie thousands of ancient tomes. Rival to the
Great Library of Palanthas, this library was once thought to have been lost
in the Cataclysm. There is no telling what secrets and wonders lie within
the pages of the books here.

[36mAn Elegant Hallway[0;37m
    This simple but elegant hallway is a brief reprieve from the nearby
maze of bookshelves. The hall here is well lit by round glowing orbs which
rest atop silver wall sconces and shine light to every corner and crevice.
It's difficult to discern the material of the sheer white walls to the
north and south, but unlike the rest of this aging library they appear
flawless. There is a large doorway set in the northern wall, an even larger
set of doors to the west lead to the library, and the hallway continues
eastward.

    Rows of bookshelves lead in all directions except for a set of doors to
the east. The lower shelves within reach appear to be stacked with hundreds
of books. The bookshelves swallow the surrounding light, making it
difficult to make out any titles without searching the shelves more
closely. The Aesthetics have put considerable work into cleaning this space
and organizing the bookshelves.

skylights that are dark and barely visible, offering no additional light.
The Aesthetics speak of this section with deep sadness, lamenting the

    It would take a keen eye to find a speck of dust among these
bookshelves after the hard work of the Aesthetics. The shelves appear to go
on forever, housing hundreds of books. Far above the highest shelves there
is a wide metal pipe which runs behind the bookshelves here, which is
likely used for drainage. The surrounding bookshelves, piping and the
balcony above could all make a person feel claustrophobic. There is an
eerie silence about this place, and each footstep echoes almost eternally.

    This simple but elegant hallway reaches a corner here, with a pathway
continuing to the south and west. The hall here is well lit by round
glowing orbs which rest atop silver wall sconces and shine light to every
corner and crevice. It's difficult to discern the material of the sheer
white walls to the south and east, but unlike the rest of this aging
library they appear flawless. There is a small doorway in the hallway to
the north, and a much larger heavy wood door in the wall to the east.

    This simple but elegant hallway reaches a corner here, with a pathway
continuing to the north and west. The hall here is well lit by round
glowing orbs which rest atop silver wall sconces and shine light to every
corner and crevice. It's difficult to discern the material of the sheer
white walls to the south and east, but unlike the rest of this aging
library they appear flawless. There is a small doorway in the hallway to
the south, and a much larger heavy wood door in the wall to the east with a
small but inviting rug at the foot of the door.

    This simply adorned room only appears to contain a few desks, but
somehow each desk appears to emit bright light which illuminates the papers
on the surface. Several open books and spare pages lie on each desk, while
a variety of quills and inks sit in small side trays. The desk closest to
the entryway appears to be a collection point for restoration work, and the
pile seems especially high. This room is clearly regularly cleaned and
maintained, and in addition to the bright restoration desks this space is
well lit by wall sconces.

    In its past use this may have been a meeting room of some sort, however

obvious delineation between the guards and Aesthetics. The Aesthetics' side
of the room is very utilitarian and sparsely furnished. The guardsman side
of the room has been refurnished using pillows and furniture from
throughout the library to make themselves more comfortable. There are large
sets of doors in the north and south ends of the sleeping quarters and a
smaller doorway in the east wall between the Aesthetic bunks.

    This simply adorned room only appears to contain a few desks, but
somehow each desk appears to emit bright light which illuminates the papers
on the surface. Several open books and spare pages lie on each desk, while
a variety of quills and inks sit in small side trays. The desk closest to
the entryway appears to be a collection point for restoration work, and the
pile seems especially high. This room is clearly regularly cleaned and
maintained, and in addition to the bright restoration desks this space is
well lit by wall sconces.

instead of baths the room has been built as showers of water that can be
used while standing. A small copper pipe rings the room wall about a foot
from the ceiling, and there are small wheel levers and pipe openings every
few feet allowing individual showers with control over water flow. The
entire room from ceiling to floor is constructed of small white stone tiles
which have been stained brown, pink and black over time from water
minerals. The entire floor is sloped gently toward the centre to allow
water to flow into a central floor drain.

[36mA Dusty Pile of Rubble[0;37m
    A stark contrast to the nearby rows, the bookshelves here have been
reduced to a large pile of rubble blocking passage in some directions. The
shelves that are still visible are broken and covered in dust, with many
books lost to the ages. Far above the bookshelf remnants there are wide
skylights that are dark and barely visible, offering no additional light.
The Aesthetics speak of this section with deep sadness, lamenting the
knowledge lost. It is difficult to move without stepping on rocks and
debris and to continue on the path north or east would be impossible.

    This section beneath the slab has not been traversed in some time, and
every small footstep stirs up clouds of dust. Although collapsed, it
appears as though this section of the library has been entirely preserved
in time and lays untouched. The shattered remnants of bookshelves and the
remains of torn books lay strewn about. The only exit from here appears to
be back out from the slab to the west.

    This row of bookshelves appears to have previously run from west to
east, but all of the bookshelves along the north wall of the library have
been been completely crushed under what looks like a fallen slab of stone
from the balcony above. Not surprisingly the bookshelves along this row
have all been destroyed, and broken remnants of the ancient vallenwood
shelves litter the floor. The path to the west is completely impassable due
to the clutter of collapsed shelves and stone debris. To the east the
remains of the fallen slab lay upon the shattered shelves. There is a
significant amount of rubble and debris scattered about the area.
