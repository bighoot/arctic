    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

[36mA Narrow Road[0;37m
    A narrow road leads south through the edge of the plains and into a
thick vallenwood forest. An arm of the Kharolis mountains lies to the west
and extends out to the north, the road turns east to lead away from the
mountains on its journey through the plains. The plains of Abanasinia
spread out to the northeast from here and you see another mountain range
off to the east. A thick forest of tall trees can be seen to the south.

[36mA Narrow Road[0;37m
    A narrow road here runs east through some plains toward the Eastwall
mountains while to the west the road continues through the plains. The
plains spread out to the west for a short distance before ending at an arm
of the Kharolis mountains. The Kharolis mountains lie off to the west and
run north-south in this area of Abanasinia. The foothills of the Eastwall
mountains can be seen off to the east and the mountain range appears to run
northeasterly from this spot.

    A narrow road winds its way to the east and west here. To the north the
flat plains stretch as far as you can see, while to the south a few
vallenwood tree start dotting the landscape, meaning you must be nearing
the peaceful town of Solace. Off to the east and the west mountain ranges
rise to the heavens, making you feel like a nut in a vise.

can be seen cutting a line through the unmolested grass of the Abanasinia

into the grassy plains. A short distance to the north west a few strands of
black smoke can be seen rising from the base of the Kharolis mountains.

plains also extend to the west where they run into an arm of the Kharolis
mountains. Judging from the height of the grass, you can only assume that
the land sandwiched between these two ranges must be very fertile.

    Waves from the Newsea crash onto the shoreline, sending spray of salty
water into the air. Strong gusts from the north whip at your clothes and
kick sand and water droplets into your face. From the eastern horizon to
the western horizon, all that can be seen are the waters of the Newsea.
Directly across the waters to the north you can barely make out a land mass
and a city, it must be Port o'Call. The sand along the shore becomes more
sparse to the south and a road leads away from the shoreline.

Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest

the occasional hardwood, though other than that the terrain is rather
monotonous. The land is hilly, though not altogether rugged, as most of the
hillsides that comprise the area are grassy or covered with small rocks.
The jagged, violent peaks of the Khalkist Mountains sneer at you high
above to the north.

These hills are the southern extent of the mightly Khalkist Mountains which
loom over you to the north. The peaks are such a bleak, dark grey, they
almost look charred against the sky. To the south the rocky road flattens
somewhat into more hilly foothills while those to the north only become
more treacherous and rocky. In the distance you can see faint signs of
smoke barely rising above the foothills far to the southwest.

summer solstice. Although the conditions can be harsh, you can see several
clumps of hardwoods providing some shade for travellers. Far east beyond

your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

cold and damp to the touch only warming where flickering torches hang from
iron sconces set in the walls. The steps lead you down to the dungeons
where Balifor's criminals are locked away ... hopefully.

[36mA Musty Cell[0;37m
    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Oaken panels stained dark line the sides of the hall, and also end it
in a solid wall to the south. From here you can access the floor above
this, what would be ground level in this subterranean building, by a flight
of stairs against the southern wall. Though you can't see into it very well
from here, you can feel the breeze of freshly circulated air from the room
above, a welcome change from the stagnant and stale air of these
underground halls. To the north the hallway you are in, meets up with
another hallway running east-west.

heroes would surely brave on to the dangers of the temple.

branch out from it's base to hold the sacrifice, and a sharp blade
protrudes in between their grip to thrust through the victim's chest. At

The priest looks quite baffled by your intrusion, and at the same time
enraged. His hands are stained with blood from a recent sacrificial victim to
Takhisis, and his black silk robes are soaked with it. Standing taller than
the average human, the priest has an imposing stature, exaggerated even more
by the deathly robes that encompass his body.
The high priest of Takhisis has some big nasty wounds and scratches.

meet up with a curved ceiling, and lead westward through a twisting
passage, while to the east the foreboding doors of a temple to the dark

though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

[36mA Musty Cell[0;37m
    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

    This narrow road runs north-south through the port. Cobbles have been
hastily laid in the dirt as befits a prosperous town. Narrow but tall
houses and buildings loom above you, cutting out some of the daylight that
shows the street traders in their full colours. Small children play in the
dirt and down small alleys that lead to places of ill-repute. To the north
lies the main trading square, much banter and joyous laughter are carried
on the fresh sea breeze.

    This path skirts the hills of Khuri-Khan, a large system of dry, grassy
foothills. The hills gradually become steeper to the north, while to the
south the land flattens out somewhat. The road is made of mulch and looks
relatively well travelled as there are many wagon ruts and footprints from
travelers who have come before you.

    A cool breeze blows in from the east where you can see the Khurman Sea
a ways off. The road becomes much larger here and to the north while to the
southeast it almost becomes buried in tall grasses. To the northwest you
can see the hills of Khuri Khan. The road skirts the sides of these rolling
hills which eventually merge with the lower, warmer hills of the Ek-Khan.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

    A flat, wavy sea of grass expands around you. Wildflowers break the
verdant monotony of the vegetation underfoot occasionally, and several wild
fruit trees and roses also dot this path of mulch. A cool breeze blows in
from the northeast. The Khurman Sea, also known as the Bay of Balifor, is
not far from here. In the distance to the southwest, beyond several
foothills, you can barely make out the towering peaks of the Khalkhist
Mountains.

    This rough road winds its way through foothills near the Khalkist
Mountains which lay to the west. Lush, flat plains extend to the east and
northeast. These hills are green, dotted by the occasional dark grey
boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or
civilization can be seen in sight, as there are few footprints and no wagon
ruts on this rugged road.

    The lands of Ak-Tubal and Kalin Ak-Phan stretch out to the east. They
are flat, dry, grassy plains infamous for their unbearable heat during the
summer solstice. Although the conditions can be harsh, you can see several
clumps of hardwoods providing some shade for travellers. Far east beyond
the huge plains you can barely make out the glittering waves of the Khurman
Sea. The altitude descends north of there, though to the south you can see
the jagged, towering peaks of the mighty Khalkist Mountains.

rising into the air.  Occasionally the ground here shakes almost
imperceptibly, trembling in response to the volcano in the distance.

These hills are the southern extent of the mightly Khalkist Mountains which
loom over you to the north. The peaks are such a bleak, dark grey, they
almost look charred against the sky. To the south the rocky road flattens
somewhat into more hilly foothills while those to the north only become
more treacherous and rocky. In the distance you can see faint signs of
smoke barely rising above the foothills far to the southwest.

The trail is rocky and somewhat unstable, through clumps of pine trees and
the occasional hardwood, though other than that the terrain is rather
monotonous. The land is hilly, though not altogether rugged, as most of the
hillsides that comprise the area are grassy or covered with small rocks.

    The road begins to narrow to the north as it grows steadily steeper.
Far in the distance, the road winds as it carves a path through the
foothills of the Khalkists. Vegetation is less sparse further up the
path, offering more sights for the arduous climb. The view to the south is
a stark contrast, as the road widens and flattens. For miles the road
continues straight with very little to see except for an expansive yellow
sea of sand.

[36mOutside the East Gate of Tarsis[0;37m
    The fortified walls of Tarsis rise up from the Plains of Dust like
mighty cliffs, defiant against the cold, harsh winds, and dwarfed only by
the fifty foot towers that nearly encircle the city. The ancient city walls
have withstood the tests of time, including the Cataclysm in all of its
fiery glory. Once called Tarsis the Beautiful, the Lordcity was a bustling
sea port, whose rich commerce brought sustainability and prosperity to the
land. The city now looks as desolate as the plains that surround it.
Tempestuous winds assail the walls with endless specks of sand, causing
minimal damage to the walls, but serving as a constant reminder that
nothing can survive forever in these wastelands.

walls stretch to the north and south.

[36mOutside the East Gate of Tarsis[0;37m
    The fortified walls of Tarsis rise up from the Plains of Dust like
mighty cliffs, defiant against the cold, harsh winds, and dwarfed only by
the fifty foot towers that nearly encircle the city. The ancient city walls
have withstood the tests of time, including the Cataclysm in all of its
fiery glory. Once called Tarsis the Beautiful, the Lordcity was a bustling
sea port, whose rich commerce brought sustainability and prosperity to the
land. The city now looks as desolate as the plains that surround it.
Tempestuous winds assail the walls with endless specks of sand, causing
minimal damage to the walls, but serving as a constant reminder that
nothing can survive forever in these wastelands.

    You walk along the forested flanks of the mountain that towers above
you. As it climbs up the slope, the path becomes more rugged than it is to
the west. Drifting on the wind from the west, you notice the faint smell of
wood smoke, and even the insects are ominously quiet.

[36mCity View[0;37m
    You have finally climbed far enough up the mountain to clear the
treeline, and a marvelous vista spreads out before you. Looking east and
down you see a large valley. It is surrounded on all sides by more
mountains, their peaks covered with snow. On the slopes of the surrounding
mountains, above the level of the trees, are what appear to be many small
farms. At the bottom of the valley is a large lake, formed by snowmelt,
which is the source of the stream you were following. On the west shore of
the lake is a village, looking tiny in the distance, and you can see smoke
rising from some of the chimneys of the homes there. But that sight does
little more than hold your attention for a moment, for your eyes are drawn
upward. Sitting high above the center of the lake is a cloud, on top of
which is one of the largest castles you have seen, its towers rising into
the clear blue skies, colorful pennants at their tops snapping in the stiff
breeze which seems to have no affect on the cloud itself.

    You have finally climbed far enough up the mountain to clear the
treeline, and a marvelous vista spreads out before you. Looking east and
down you see a large valley. It is surrounded on all sides by more
mountains, their peaks covered with snow. On the slopes of the surrounding
mountains, above the level of the trees, are what appear to be many small
farms. At the bottom of the valley is a large lake, formed by snowmelt,
which is the source of the stream you were following. On the west shore of
the lake is a village, looking tiny in the distance, and you can see smoke
rising from some of the chimneys of the homes there. But that sight does
little more than hold your attention for a moment, for your eyes are drawn
upward. Sitting high above the center of the lake is a cloud, on top of
which is one of the largest castles you have seen, its towers rising into
the clear blue skies, colorful pennants at their tops snapping in the stiff
breeze which seems to have no affect on the cloud itself.

    The tranquility of the lake is momentarily broken by a flock of low
flying birds.  Just as they pass overhead, you notice a small ledge that has
been carved into the cliff face about twenty feet above you.  As you look for
a suitable way to reach this ledge, your eyes spot small nooks and niches in
the solid rock wall.  They look like hand and foot holds that have been placed
to make the ledge reachable.  The trickling water makes the rock look slick,
but it appears to be climbable at this spot.

There seems to be no way ashore here as the jagged rocks jutting out of the

Stretching out before you is a lake, formed from the melting snows high

make out some large huts on the west side of the lake, smoke rising from

    The path is nearly invisible here as the vegetation on the plush
mountainside has covered all but a few small spots here and there.
All around you, the only things you can see are trees and more trees.
Moss covered tree trunks are all around you and the spruce and pine
branches overhead form a canopy that almost shuts out all light.  The
spots of the path you can see seem to bend upward to the east and
straight down as well.

[36mThe Steep Path[0;37m
    A small bend in the path sends it shooting westward down the
mountainside.  Thicker vegetation lies below you here as the thinner air
up above makes the number of trees thin out ever so slightly.  Straight
above you the path continues up the mountain into the shadows created
by the canopy of tree limbs overhead.

    Tall pine trees line the sides of this path and extend as far as the eye
can see.  Small chirps and howls can be heard echoing all around you
as you traverse the steeply inclined path.  Almost straight down from you
the path disappears over a small ridge into even more trees.  To the
south, the path contiues up the mountainside.

[36mA Steep Mountain Path[0;37m
    Pine trees of all shapes and sizes form a huge canopy of vegetation
that makes seeing anything except the sky, the trees and the path nearly
impossible.  The sharp angle of the path and the undergrowth that has
crept onto this seldom used trail makes careful movement a must.  It
looks as if the path emerges from the trees above, as the trail looks
to be much brighter there.  To the north, the path decends sharply into
the darkening forest.

[36mCity View[0;37m
    You have finally climbed far enough up the mountain to clear the
treeline, and a marvelous vista spreads out before you. Looking east and
down you see a large valley. It is surrounded on all sides by more
mountains, their peaks covered with snow. On the slopes of the surrounding
mountains, above the level of the trees, are what appear to be many small
farms. At the bottom of the valley is a large lake, formed by snowmelt,
which is the source of the stream you were following. On the west shore of
the lake is a village, looking tiny in the distance, and you can see smoke
rising from some of the chimneys of the homes there. But that sight does
little more than hold your attention for a moment, for your eyes are drawn
upward. Sitting high above the center of the lake is a cloud, on top of
which is one of the largest castles you have seen, its towers rising into
the clear blue skies, colorful pennants at their tops snapping in the stiff
breeze which seems to have no affect on the cloud itself.

From the size of the castle, one would assume giants had built it. Off to

feet below, one's own mortality is suddenly very clear. Only the ability to
fly could possibly keep one from crashing to the water below, in what would
undoubtedly be a very painful death.

    Seemingly undisturbed for ages, this large lake is calmer and
clearer than any body of water you have ever seen.  High mountains
enclose the valley on all sides making this area very secluded and
peaceful looking.  To the west, some small trails of smoke can be seen
rising into the sky from what looks to be large huts.  A path leads up the
mountainside south of you and the lake stretches out in all other
directions.

    The serene waters end as sheer rock walls rise blocking your way to
the south and east.  As you raise your sights higher, you see the rock faces
begin to fall away from the vertical wall.  Further up, large pine trees form
a densely thatched forest.  Water trickles down the cliff walls, the result
of the melting snow which replenishes this lake.  As you are looking upward,
something catches your eye.  Atop a cloud high above you see what looks like a
castle wall with bright colored banners atop the towers.  Sure that you are
hallucinating you return your gaze to the valley.

    The calm waters barely ripple against the cliff wall that bars your
movement to the east.  Melting snow trickles down the sheer wall and into the
lake. The scent of pine hovers in the breeze as the forest high above sways
to and fro in the wind.  The tranquility here makes you want to stop and just
take in the scenery.

[36mCrystal Blue Lake[0;37m
    The jagged rocks lining the west side of the lake part here leaving
an opening into a small secluded cove.  Peering through the opening you
can see a large fire giving off the smoke you had noticed earlier.  Near the
fire are enormous huts.  You can't make out the exact size or shape of them
from this distance though.  The cove opens up to the west while moving in any
other direction takes you out further on the lake.

[36mA Sheltered Cove[0;37m
    Leaving the crystal clear waters of the snowmelt lake, you find
yourself in a small cove.   The mountains rise on either side of you to the
north and south, but here in this sheltered area, a village unlike many you
have ever seen rests.  Enormous huts standing nearly thirty feet tall have been
constructed all around the flattened land here.  A large fire burns in the
center of the village.  Giant-sized life forms wander in and out of the huts
and around the village.  From this closer vantage point you can see that some
of the homes have chimneys on them.  Small puffs of smoke rise from their tops
and dissipate in the sky above.

    The cove opens into a wide area that has been flattened out and
cleared of debris.  Extremely large huts spring up to and fro, smoke
emanating from chimneys on some and loud noises from others.  As you survey
the area, you see enormous humanoids moving about the village.  None of
them seem to notice your presence in their secluded home.  The village itself
opens to the west while paths to the north and south move around the outskirts
of the area.  Looking back to the east you see the peaceful bay and the lake
beyond. High above the lake, the gentle breezes push the clouds along
their way except for one that remains strangely still.  From this vantage
point, you see the spires of what looks like a castle atop the cloud.  Banners
blow gently in the wind as this castle in the sky hovers over the entire lake
area.

    The wide path turns to the south here where it narrows to the
entrance of by far the largest hut in the village.  Massive fifteen foot tall
torches stand at either side of the path lighting the entrance to this hut.
The building itself stands a good forty feet in height and is easily three
times as wide as the rest in the village.  There are no doors on the entrance
to the hut, but the guards posted there do not seem to be to likely to let
people by without a good reason.

    This room is almost entirely empty with the exception of some chairs
near the south exit.  A massive domed ceiling rises to a forty foot high
peak falling to no less than twenty-five feet or so at the outskirts of
the room.  Large torches hung fifteen feet high are evenly spaced around the
room, providing ample light to see.  This appears to be a lobby area for the
villagers to gather to see whomever it is that resides in this place.  A
large arched doorway leads to another room to the south while the doorway
to the north leads outdoors.

Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

[36mSouthern Avenue[0;37m
    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    The avenue twists and turns among the huge vallenwoods. Sounds of life
are all around you. Looking up, you see the sun peeking through the dense
canopy of the forest. As you walk among the forest life, you feel safe and
at ease. You see a large stone building to the east. The avenue continues
to the north and south. A small sign is posted on the stone building.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.
