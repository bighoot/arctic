here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and

foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

this bridge almost pleasant to walk on. You can get a good look at the gully
now and judge its depth to be almost eighty feet. Your knuckles turn white
and you become thankful the dwarves built handrails on this bridge. The path
you are on continues both east and west.

the canyon. Peering down into it, there is no trace of water. Judging by the
size of the rounded boulders however, you can imagine the force of a flash
flood raging through here. The dwarves of Thorbardin have taken this into
account and constructed a large sturdy bridge over the gully.

There is not much visible from here, due to the everpresent moist fog that
envelops everything. You can make out several humanoid figures milling
about nearby and several nets and racks of drying fish have been built near
the edge of the plateau. You can vaguely remember stories about an

the plateau, to the south. The lake is below you, at the bottom of a steep

[36mA Path Away from the Village[0;37m
    The stone path leads away from the village. The path is lined on either
side by large stones, which are there to mark the walkway. The path
meanders along the edge of the plateau. The fog is light here, allowing you
to see parts of a dark cold lake that sits like a mirror below you. A high
cliff is to your east and the stone boundaries of the road prevent you from
wandering over the edge in the fog. The path rises slightly to the south,
where a stone slab sits atop a hill.

    This high perch looks out over the dark lake waters. The fog is almost
negligable here, allowing you to take in your surroundings. From this vantage
point, you can see part of the lake and the village on its rocky shore.
Kuo-toa scouts roam the lake and guards walk the village. You cannot see the
full extent of the lake here but it is almost like a small sea. A smooth
stone slab is here and has curious offerings to whatever God this curious
amphibious race prays to.

the west, while strange chanting can be heard from the north. A hut built
from sewn patches of animal skins stretched across the vallenwood branches
lie to the east. A small grove can be seen at the base of the tree, as a
small branch slopes gently down from here providing passage. Finally, the
bough moves back toward the trunk to the south.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by

limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    This clearing is set off from the main road. The lush undergrowth of
the forest forms a living boundary around its edges. In the center of the
clearing is a huge vallenwood. Looking up into the vallenwood, you spy what
looks like a small shop. A stairway spirals down around the trunk, reaching
the ground right before you. Northern Avenue is visible to your west. A
small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

[36mThe Old Mine[0;37m
    The hillside continues to climb higher in the Kharolis and the path
into the mine burrows straight into the heart of the mountain. A pile of
junk and rusty rocks litter the opening to the mine. Inside, the shaft
continues into the darkness. To the south, the poisoned landscape looks
like a bright orange desert.

that was once mined here. The side shaft continues east while the main

acidic mine waters are eating away at the rock faces, which seem to be much

pieces of limestone litter the floor and the sound of dripping water can be
heard echoing throughout the chamber. You see a small pool of acrid water
with water slowly dripping into it from above.

    The walls of the mine seem to be receeding at this point. Timber stands
up at least several feet from the walls and forms a bizarre framework. The
acidic mine waters are eating away at the rock faces, which seem to be much
different from the dark ore-bearing rock of the rest of the mine. Large
pieces of limestone litter the floor and the sound of dripping water can be
heard echoing throughout the chamber. You see a small pool of acrid water
with water slowly dripping into it from above.

    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a neighboring
vallenwood tree.

    The bough of this vallenwood tree is wide enough to allow ten people to
walk across side by side. You notice a small temple to the east with scores
of people moving in and out, heads bowed. to the west, devout knights seek
solace and divine intervention in a shrine built into a branch. To the
south the bough climbs upward at forty-five degrees, but footholds and
handholds allow for easy progress upwards.

narrow points. The bog is rather wide to the east, but not quite as wide to
the west. The road has been built up with stones, wood and dirt to maintain
a stable platform for travellers. Its not a work of art but it does the

cannot lift your feet. They are stuck fast in the mud and try as you might,
you cannot pull them free. You can feel your feet slowly sinking into the

and struggle to pull yourself free, but it only makes you sink quicker.
Finding no choice, you stop struggling and sit still, waiting to die.

    Moving quickly through the bog, your foot suddenly catches on
something beneath the water and you plunge head first into the murky water
beneath you. Attempting to pick yourself up from the mud, you find that you
cannot lift your feet. They are stuck fast in the mud and try as you might,
you cannot pull them free. You can feel your feet slowly sinking into the
mud, pulling you deeper and deeper into the water of the bog. Soon, the
water will be over your head and you will not be able to breathe. You grasp
and struggle to pull yourself free, but it only makes you sink quicker.
Finding no choice, you stop struggling and sit still, waiting to die.

    Spilling onto a stone floor, surrounded by dirty, murky water that
flows in from the hole in the ceiling, you gasp for air and try to expel
the water that remains in your lungs. Breathing heavily after clearing your
lungs, you finally manage to get a clean breath of air. Feeling stone
beneath you, you pause a moment to take in your surroundings. The air is
dank and musty, and darkness lies in every direction. Holding your light to
look around, you discover that a passage of some kind lies to the east. It
appears as though the bog has dumped you into some old, abandoned tunnel.

    You are on a rather wide road. This avenue leads south and north
through the town. To the north, you see buildings built up in the limbs of
the huge vallenwoods. This view of Solace shows you how much the village
depends on the ancient trees for life and sustenance. The avenue leads

    A large bog lies to the south east and west directions. The road here
has been built up to maintain a dry and stable platform for the many
travellers passing through these parts. In some spots the bog has reclaimed
the land that once belonged to it. Foothills can be seen to the west and
north directions. To the north the foothills slowly give way to the plains
of Dergoth. The raised road through the bog leads to the north and east
from here.

prance slightly from side to side, stirring up the muck, to avoid being

Straining with every step to pull your feet from the thick, encompassing

BANDIT SWAMP
============

BACKGROUND:

Decades ago, bandit swamp use to border a beautiful and peaceful forest to
the north of it. A clan of forest guardians worked hard to defend the
forest and keep the order there. This forest was known throughout Krynn,
and adventurers often enjoyed relaxing in the forest's beauty. However, all
this changed in one fateful, dark night. A group of bandits laid siege upon
the forest guardians in the cover of night, staging their attack from a
concealed entrance from the swamp to the south. The bandits mercilessly
murdered many of the guardians and seized control of the area. Now the
forest is populated with foul creatures and no one dares to enter it for
fear of their life. Recent rumours reveal that the son of the head forest
guardian has been trying to raise help to free his father from captivity,
although the location of his father is still unknown, or whether he is even
alive at all.

RECOMMENDED LEVELS:

The swamp and forest are suitable for mid-level adventurers to explore.
However, only a small group of experienced adventurers [18-24] can explore
the region to the fullest.

LOCATION:

The swamp is widely known to border the eastern edge of the forests far
to the east of Balifor.

leading through some verdant rolling hills. The sky is partially cloudy,

the terrain opens up into a vast desert known as the Plains of Dust. There
is almost a distinguishable line where the sands from the plains meets the

that, though not visible, lies the waters of New Sea. Ogre Peaks and Onyx
Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name
suggests, is home to many ogres. The land to the north is a mighty plain
known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.

The trees and foliage provide an impassable barrier to entering the forest
from here, forming a natural border with the rest of the world. To the east

water. The swamp stretches to the southeast from here.

throughout the area here. Travel through the dense forest to the north is

struggle that each step brings, tires you nonetheless. To the immediate
north, a dense forest rises up, making travel in that direction impossible
from here. The swamp extends in every other direction around you.

The swamp extends far to the south and the west from here. Dense trees have

direction. One of the larger trees from the forest is overhanging above
you. A small, well-traveled path leads north from the swamp, directly into

waters are low along the northern edge of the swamp here, yet the constant
struggle that each step brings, tires you nonetheless. To the immediate
north, a dense forest rises up, making travel in that direction impossible
from here. The swamp extends in every other direction around you.

     You are at the southwest corner of the swamp. The swamp's tall reeds
and spongy ground makes movement grueling through the swamp. Blocking your
travel to the west is a dense forest with no noticeable path through it
Also to your south, tall, dense trees block your way. With no possible exit
from here, you will have to find another way out of the swamp.

     As you reach the western edge of the swamp, you mutter with disgust as
the stench begins to take its affect on you. Traveling through the swamp
has gotten your boots and pants filled with water. The swamp comes to an
end to the west against a dense forest that you cannot pass through. Your
only course of travel is back deeper into the swamp in the hope of finding
an exit from it.

you can make out a small path that appears to be leading out of the swamp.
The ground is very wet and spongy, and you have a little difficulty moving
around. Curiously, you find some glittering white bones scattered all over
the place.

The ground is very wet and spongy, and you have a little difficulty moving

     You are at the northwest corner of the swamp. The swamp gives way to a
dense forest to the north and west. Even at the edge of the swamp here, the
ground is still very wet, filling your boots with even more grimy swamp
water. The swamp stretches to the southeast from here.

     As you reach the western edge of the swamp, you mutter with disgust as
the stench begins to take its affect on you. Traveling through the swamp
has gotten your boots and pants filled with water. The swamp comes to an
end to the west against a dense forest that you cannot pass through. Your
only course of travel is back deeper into the swamp in the hope of finding
an exit from it.

Also to your south, tall, dense trees block your way. With no possible exit
from here, you will have to find another way out of the swamp.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

[36mSouthern Avenue[0;37m
    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a neighboring

battles. Suits of armour and racks of weapons line the walls. All around
you, young trainees battle stuffed dummies as they practice and hone their
skills with various weapons. A small door leads east.

    The bough of this vallenwood narrows as it extends further south. A
school for budding warriors lies to the west while a clearing on a junction
of boughs can be seen to the east. You have a strange feeling that you are
being watched especially since the thick vallenwood canopy provides
excellent hiding spots for those skilled in being unseen. The trunk of this
massive vallenwood lies back to the north, and can be reached easily by the
footholds and handholds in the bough leading down.

emanates from a pot on the fire, you wonder if it is dinner or a potion.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    The bough of this vallenwood narrows as it extends further south. A
school for budding warriors lies to the west while a clearing on a junction
of boughs can be seen to the east. You have a strange feeling that you are
being watched especially since the thick vallenwood canopy provides
excellent hiding spots for those skilled in being unseen. The trunk of this
massive vallenwood lies back to the north, and can be reached easily by the
footholds and handholds in the bough leading down.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    The avenue twists and turns among the huge vallenwoods. Sounds of life
are all around you. Looking up, you see the sun peeking through the dense
canopy of the forest. As you walk among the forest life, you feel safe and
at ease. You see a large stone building to the east. The avenue continues
to the north and south. A small sign is posted on the stone building.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot

north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    The road continues, snaking through the rocky wilderness. It makes a
large curve to avoid a big boulder, jutting out from the surrounding hills.
You have heard tales of bandits surviving off of travellers on the roadways
of Krynn, and it occurs to you that this would be an excellent spot for an
ambush. The road continues to the north and south.

    A small dirt road leads west into the settlement of Harrying. To the
east the dirt road becomes nothing more than a path which dies among the
vast plains of Solamnia. On the side of the road to the south you see signs
of recent campfires, most likely a resting spot for one of the many
caravans that pass through Harrying on their way to the cities of Solamnia.
A paddock to the north keeps some horses from wandering off into the vast
plains.

split up to take some of their goods to Caergoth while others take their
wares to the port city of Port o'Call on the shores of the Newsea. These
caravans would normally head toward the main road just west of here on
their way to Caergoth and Port o'Call. A small path ends in the heart of

here. As you pause to enjoy the odors, you notice the road through Harrying

    A narrow road here runs east through some plains toward the Eastwall
mountains while to the west the road continues through the plains. The
plains spread out to the west for a short distance before ending at an arm
of the Kharolis mountains. The Kharolis mountains lie off to the west and
run north-south in this area of Abanasinia. The foothills of the Eastwall
mountains can be seen off to the east and the mountain range appears to run
northeasterly from this spot.

    The road is cut from among the huge vallenwoods which protect and house
the inhabitants of Solace. The limbs overhead entwine with one another to
provide a canopy of green foliage which filters out the heat of the sun,
while allowing dim light to shine through. One particularly large
vallenwood stands at the edge of the road. Looking up into it, you notice a
rather large temple is nestled among the limbs. A small stairway spirals
down around the trunk and ends at the road, providing an entry to the
temple. The road itself leads east deeper into the forest and west towards

[36mSouthern Avenue[0;37m
    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

east. To the southeast, the fishing community of Newport can be clearly
seen, surrounded on three sides by a bay of the New Sea. Fishing boats dot
the waters of the bay, as Newport citizens toil away in their trade. The
forested hills grow west of the bay, filling the view with tall oaks and
maples. Far to the south, the peace of the Kharolis Mountains rise in
majestic shadow.

small fishing community, Newport. Beyond Newport is a bay of the New Sea,
its waters stretching out across the horizon. The cobblestone continues to
the north, signifying the beginnings of a major trade route to the towns of

[36mA Road to the Bay[0;37m
    The smell of salty air is carried by a warming breeze to the north and
east. To the southeast, the fishing community of Newport can be clearly
seen, surrounded on three sides by a bay of the New Sea. Fishing boats dot
the waters of the bay, as Newport citizens toil away in their trade. The
forested hills grow west of the bay, filling the view with tall oaks and
maples. Far to the south, the peace of the Kharolis Mountains rise in
majestic shadow.

    The road is wide here and paved with cobblestone in spots. You see the
marks of a wagon in the dirt spots of the road, left by the increasing
number of merchants travelling between Newport and the towns of Solace and
Haven. Around you the landscape is dotted with trees and the area is hilly.
In the air you can faintly smell salt, carried by a breeze blowing from the
northeast. The road leads to the north and east from here. Southeast you can
hear the sounds of a bustling town and to the north you hear a low rumbling.

[36mCrossing the River White-Rage[0;37m
    Looking around as you cross the immense stone bridge, you gaze in awe
at a pair of huge pillars of stone. The pillars seem to be the main
foundation of the structure, keeping it a safe distance from the raging
waters below. Even from here, you can hear the roar from the river below as
it crashes into the pillars and is forced around them. The stone bridge
stretches northward, high above the river, but the southern bank is still
reassuringly nearby.

[36mNorthern Avenue[0;37m
    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

[36mA Small Side Street[0;37m
    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

[36mThe Inn of the Last Home[0;37m
    The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace dominates
one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill the
room. A stairway leads up, further into the tree, while another stairway
leads down to the forest below.

    The reception contains a small desk. A long hall leads behind the desk
here and you can tell this is where adventurers rest and take time off from
their journeys. A small stairway goes down towards what appears to be a
lively tavern.
