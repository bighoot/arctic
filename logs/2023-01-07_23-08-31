onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

[36mA Musty Cell[0;37m
    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the

source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Standing before double doors carved with the two common visages of
Takhisis, you are immediately struck by a powerful evil aura. Stone walls
meet up with a curved ceiling, and lead westward through a twisting
passage, while to the east the foreboding doors of a temple to the dark
goddess lie before you. Clearly the coward's way is to flee west away from
the danger within, though those who wish to follow in the footsteps of
heroes would surely brave on to the dangers of the temple.

strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and

west lies the front area where new prisoners are registered before being
thrown in their cells. Several torches hang from the opposite walls,
lighting your way. In the south wall a flight of stairs ascends to the

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the

of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

    King's Road was once a grand elevated highway which was supported
by large pillars thirty feet in the air running on pillars for 600 miles
from Thon-Thalas in the east to Purstal in the west. Originally molded from
stone by House Mason of the Silvanesti Elves as a means to travel from
Silvanesti, through the Plains of Dust and into Qualinesti, it was widely
used by merchants and travelers, however during the Cataclysm the highway
collapsed near Purstal and lies in ruins further west of that point.

    The elevated highway that is King's road rises thirty feet beyond the
ground. Having been broken during the Cataclysm, the road is now a shell of
its former self. Aside from the road's state of disrepair, it sits too high
from the ground to be travelled on. Still, the ancient road serves as a
worthy guide through the harsh plains and towards the kingdom of
Silvanesti. To the west, the road has collapsed, leaving behind tall
pillars of stone that stretch out towards the sky and supporting nothing.

    King's Road runs parallel to the Khaldat river, too high and too
ruined to be used as a means of transport. Broken columns reach towards the
sky, a reminder of what was and what will never be, while the saffron
colored sands blow in invisible winds. The faint sound of scurrying can be
detected if one ignores the bubbling burble of the broad river stretching
east and south into the Plains of Dust. The sound is probably from the
small animals that call the desolation their home.

    This once grand and beautifully crafted highway has been ravaged by the
harsh surrounding sands. It is said that King's Road once cut entirely
across what is now known as the Plains of Dust, leading all the way to
Sancrist. There is, however, little proof of King's Road extending beyond
this point, as anything that may lie further west is buried beneath the
sands. The road has collapsed, leaving heaps of rubble and debris on the
sands. King's road continues east, but is inaccessible from the ground.
Instead a much simpler road has been formed and runs alongside it's base.

[36mEast Road[0;37m
    The road continues east and west here, surrounded by the chilly
monotony of the Plains of Dust. Icy gusts of wind tear relentlessly at you
from the south as they drift violently in from the depths of the Icewall
glaciers. Dry skies expand overhead, as rain is a commodity in these
parts of Krynn. You can barely make out Tarsis, lying nestled in the heart
of the plains west from here. More dust greets you to the east.

[36mEast Road Junction[0;37m
    A jaded, frigid, azure sky expands above you, a swirling sea of cloud
and wind. Pummeling you from the south, glacial winds send clouds of dust
billowing around you. The howling winds scream into your ears and tear at
your clothes, as if rogue, elemental scavengers. Barren, rocky soil offers
little comfort from the relentless winds, and the only sign of life you can
see is deep wagon ruts on this well-travelled road, most of which seem to
be headed east to west, towards the city of Tarsis.

[36mThe Road to Tarsis[0;37m
    This, the road to Tarsis, strides boldly through the Plains of Dust,
plunging eastward through the plains and west towards the exotic city of
Tarsis. Glacial winds gust in from the south, hampering your journey. The
plains respond to these forceful winds, born in the heart of Icewall, with
incredible dust storms that constantly threaten to encroach upon Tarsis and
the roads leading to her. Very few plants have the will or tenacity to try
growing on these rocky soils, and the slightest green of a stubborn moss is
a sight for sore eyes.

[36mOutside the East Gate of Tarsis[0;37m
    The fortified walls of Tarsis rise up from the Plains of Dust like
mighty cliffs, defiant against the cold, harsh winds, and dwarfed only by
the fifty foot towers that nearly encircle the city. The ancient city walls
have withstood the tests of time, including the Cataclysm in all of its
fiery glory. Once called Tarsis the Beautiful, the Lordcity was a bustling
sea port, whose rich commerce brought sustainability and prosperity to the
land. The city now looks as desolate as the plains that surround it.
Tempestuous winds assail the walls with endless specks of sand, causing
minimal damage to the walls, but serving as a constant reminder that
nothing can survive forever in these wastelands.

walls stretch to the north and south.

    The path ends in a deserted cul-de-sac surrounded by old buildings. The
neighborhood has been deemed old Tarsis by the denizens of the city and is
now home to ruffians and strays. Ivy climbs along the ruined structures and
heaps of stone, masking the dark rock with delicate tendrils of green.
Patches of bramble rose sprout from beneath the rubble, poking through the
debris and junk.

[36mA Narrow and Winding Staircase[0;37m
    The narrow stone steps of this staircase are lit every few feet by
torches gently seated in wall sconces. The scattered debris suggests this
staircase is not regularly maintained, but despite this the structure has
withstood the test of time very well, though how long it has been here is
hard to say. The winding stairs continue up to a small metal hatch above,
and descends to the west.

[36mAn Unadorned Antechamber[0;37m
    This dimly lit and unadorned chamber acts as the entryway to a simple
chapel to the north. The chamber is scarce of anything, save but a few
torches in wall sconces which do not provide enough light. Some dust and
debris has collected in the corners of the room which suggests it is not
regularly looked after. The sturdy stone walls of this chamber are nearly
unmarred except for a few striations slightly visible in the shadows of
torchlight.

    The double doors to the west have been carved from a rather ordinary

from the doors allowing them to be pulled open. Sconces line the walls
throughout this chamber except for along a plain brick wall to the east.

    Years of neglect have not been kind to the buildings surrounding the

causing debris and fallen stone to litter the place. Mounds of crates and
abandoned junk have been stacked to make this alley nearly impassable.
Nearing the end of the alleyway the stone path has been hastily cleared
abutting the brick wall to the west.

heaps of stone, masking the dark rock with delicate tendrils of green.

    The fortified walls of Tarsis rise up from the Plains of Dust like
mighty cliffs, defiant against the cold, harsh winds, and dwarfed only by
the fifty foot towers that nearly encircle the city. The ancient city walls
have withstood the tests of time, including the Cataclysm in all of its
fiery glory. Once called Tarsis the Beautiful, the Lordcity was a bustling
sea port, whose rich commerce brought sustainability and prosperity to the
land. The city now looks as desolate as the plains that surround it.
Tempestuous winds assail the walls with endless specks of sand, causing
minimal damage to the walls, but serving as a constant reminder that
nothing can survive forever in these wastelands.

    This, the road to Tarsis, strides boldly through the Plains of Dust,
plunging eastward through the plains and west towards the exotic city of
Tarsis. Glacial winds gust in from the south, hampering your journey. The
plains respond to these forceful winds, born in the heart of Icewall, with
incredible dust storms that constantly threaten to encroach upon Tarsis and
the roads leading to her. Very few plants have the will or tenacity to try
growing on these rocky soils, and the slightest green of a stubborn moss is

other than those and a few shrubs, the hills are mostly barren. The fenced

    Although the Plains of Dust are generally barren and frigid, this scenic
road offers a pleasant view of the surrounding valley. The hard-packed road
winds through the gradually sloping hills, which helps protect you from the
sharp, crisp breeze flowing in from the south. Lone pine trees and shrubs
dot the hillsides and struggle for survival in this barren wasteland. The
trees remind you of the tenacity of the barbarians and nomads that inhabit
much of the inhospitable region. The road continues through the valley to
the west, and rises gently as it cuts through the hills to the north.

the forest of Silvanesti. The southern tip of the Khalkist mountains lies a
great distance towards the west, and rise up like towering giants. Beyond
that, though not visible, lies the waters of New Sea. Ogre Peaks and Onyx
Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name
suggests, is home to many ogres. The land to the north is a mighty plain
known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.
Skirting the northern tip of the Silvanesti forest, the road continues east
into the lands of Khur.

    The edge of a great forest lies to the south, filled with ancient

The trees and foliage provide an impassable barrier to entering the forest
from here, forming a natural border with the rest of the world. To the east
and west, a well travelled path continues east along the edge of the forest,
and west to an intersection. To the north, you can see the plains of Blode
in the distance, which are home to towns and cities alike.

    The beating sun bakes the dirt road in such heat that the road has
cracked into what almost resembles cobblestones. Insects scurry across,
careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only
option is to continue either north or south.

continues straight with very little to see except for an expansive yellow
sea of sand.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,

the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.

luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    The tunnel takes an abrupt turn here, leading into darkness both south
and west. A melodic trickling sound echoes through the cavernous walls, its
source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

[36mThe End of a Tunnel[0;37m
    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the
tunnel continues into darkness.

[36mA Musty Cell[0;37m
    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    It would be wise to keep a hand on your purse in this place. Certainly,
there is no love lost between the filthy street urchins who are being

an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the

toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently

the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the

By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in

[36mJunction One[0;37m
    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

the main tunnel but little doors in the tunnel, reveal homes dug into the
side walls. Deep treads in the center of the road, indicate the path of the
mining carts to both the west and south. Mounted torches, light this region
from the ceiling down. The way south leads to a junction in the tunnel,

    In this residential area of Deep Mine, some homes have been dug
directly into the side of the tunnel. Against the western wall, however, a
large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.

[36mThe Golden Lane[0;37m
    While dubbed the 'Golden Lane', this slender tunnel-path hardly passes
as anything greater than an alley. And though completely extravagant, gold
is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.
