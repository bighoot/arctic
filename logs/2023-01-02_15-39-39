    The fresh sea breeze blows cold against your unguarded face, its salty
odour bringing with it the smell of the fisherman's catch. The deep blue
ocean rolls its waves gently against the wooden jetties and piers. The
slapping of water on wood is the only sound that can be heard above the
wailing of hungry sea birds. The road leads along the sea-front, passing
between small boats and rotting wooden shacks that house the hardy
fishermen.

    A stench has come to rest in this small path, a stench that is
uncommonly rank. The smell of fish permeates the air and dominates all
thoughts. The cobblestones underfoot are part of a small alley between a
building to the north and the town wall to the south, but they seem to
serve a much more malevolent purpose. This alley has become a storage
center for the refuse of both the dockyards to the west and the fish market
to the east. Piles of disregarded fish pieces litter the area, other
unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting
development this alley has become over the years.

[36mThe Gilded Parrot Inn[0;37m
    A very nice surprise in the midst of the market, the Gilded Parrot is a
quaint little inn. The receptionist desk is made of a beautiful piece of
oak with large birds carved into the front and sides. A small stair case
leads up to the rooms just behind the desk. The railing on the staircase is
also of oak with beautiful workmanship on it as well. A rather loud tavern
can be heard to the north, the sounds of enjoyment waft through the door
and wash over the inn's lobby.

    A small path between two buildings that follows the curve of the city

    The sounds and smells of a market surround the area. Quite a few shops
and stands can be seen, all with wonderous objects to sell. The market
isn't too large, but it does extend to the west for a little bit. The
market is not so crowded at this point, the number of stores is quite low
here. A small fruit stand is just north. A short alley sits to the south,
it is well lit, but still a little spooky.

    The further away from the docks and fish stands, the less likely the

altogether, there is even a hint of apple in the air. The fruits are
displayed on a wooden cart and lined up in rows. The stand is in shambles,
but the fruit appears to be in peak form, ripe and free from bruises.

    A small path between two buildings that follows the curve of the city
wall leads from the market to a good sized inn and tavern. The Gilded
Parrot Inn stands to the east and appears to be quite a nice establishment
for the wayward traveler. The fish market dominates the exit to the north.
This alley has been kept clean and well lit, probably by the owners of the
inn.

isn't too large, but it does extend to the west for a little bit. The

    The further away from the docks and fish stands, the less likely the

altogether, there is even a hint of apple in the air. The fruits are
displayed on a wooden cart and lined up in rows. The stand is in shambles,
but the fruit appears to be in peak form, ripe and free from bruises.

thoughts. The cobblestones underfoot are part of a small alley between a
building to the north and the town wall to the south, but they seem to
serve a much more malevolent purpose. This alley has become a storage
center for the refuse of both the dockyards to the west and the fish market
to the east. Piles of disregarded fish pieces litter the area, other
unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting
development this alley has become over the years.

serve a much more malevolent purpose. This alley has become a storage
center for the refuse of both the dockyards to the west and the fish market

unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting

    The sounds and smells of a market surround the area. Quite a few shops
and stands can be seen, all with wonderous objects to sell. The market
isn't too large, but it does extend to the east and west from this spot.
The bustle of the market can't manage to drown out the sounds of the docks
which are ways off to the west. A vegetable stand has been setup just south
of here by one of the nearby farmers. What appears to be a fishing supply
store stands to the north.

    The store looks more like a sewing shop than a fisherman's hang out.
There are many tables and stools strewn about, with large nets in all
degrees of disrepair sitting on top of them. Some small poles are in a rack
on the backwall, no line or hooks on them, apparently they need a bit of
work. A small table sits at the front of the store full of items that are
ready to be bought.

lavish by the standards of this fish market. There are actually some
decorations on the walls, tapestries, paintings and even a flower basket.
The vegetables range from great to fair condition, but the lovely decor
makes everything look just a little bit better.

    A good sized, boisterous tavern, the Gutted Fish is famous for its
ruckus patrons and strong ale. Many tables are scattered about, but not
many free seats can be found. A large fire rages in the corner, some people
huddle around it attempting to avoid being seen. A bar occupies the east
wall and is covered in all assortments of alcoholic delights.

    A very nice surprise in the midst of the market, the Gilded Parrot is a
quaint little inn. The receptionist desk is made of a beautiful piece of
oak with large birds carved into the front and sides. A small stair case
leads up to the rooms just behind the desk. The railing on the staircase is
also of oak with beautiful workmanship on it as well. A rather loud tavern
can be heard to the north, the sounds of enjoyment waft through the door
and wash over the inn's lobby.

for the wayward traveler. The fish market dominates the exit to the north.
This alley has been kept clean and well lit, probably by the owners of the

isn't too large, but it does extend to the west for a little bit. The
market is not so crowded at this point, the number of stores is quite low
here. A small fruit stand is just north. A short alley sits to the south,

building to the north and the town wall to the south, but they seem to
serve a much more malevolent purpose. This alley has become a storage
center for the refuse of both the dockyards to the west and the fish market
to the east. Piles of disregarded fish pieces litter the area, other
unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting
development this alley has become over the years.

isn't too large, but it does extend to the west for a little bit. The
market is not so crowded at this point, the number of stores is quite low
here. A small fruit stand is just north. A short alley sits to the south,
it is well lit, but still a little spooky.

isn't too large, but it does extend to the east and west from this spot.
The bustle of the market can't manage to drown out the sounds of the docks
which are ways off to the west. A vegetable stand has been setup just south
of here by one of the nearby farmers. What appears to be a fishing supply
store stands to the north.

building to the north and the town wall to the south, but they seem to
serve a much more malevolent purpose. This alley has become a storage
center for the refuse of both the dockyards to the west and the fish market
to the east. Piles of disregarded fish pieces litter the area, other
unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting
development this alley has become over the years.

against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    Thrifty blankets cover the stacked beds here, occasionally rising and
falling from the heavy breathing of a tired recruit. Cheap footlockers peek
out from underneath the bottom bunks, their flimsy metal frames barely
protecting the recruits' only belongings. The barrack continues westward,
and to the south a stone archway leads into a twisting hall.

    Twisting on it's way through the ground floor of this building, the
hallway runs south to a stairway and east where it curves around the corner
of a mess hall. Two stone archways lead openly to the north and west, into
the soldiers' barracks. A chilling breeze runs through the hallway,
sweeping across the building through open windows.

here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.
