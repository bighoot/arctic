    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

[36mNear the Shore of Newsea[0;37m
    Waves from the Newsea crash onto the shoreline, sending spray of salty
water into the air. Strong gusts from the north whip at your clothes and
kick sand and water droplets into your face. From the eastern horizon to
the western horizon, all that can be seen are the waters of the Newsea.
Directly across the waters to the north you can barely make out a land mass
and a city, it must be Port o'Call. The sand along the shore becomes more
sparse to the south and a road leads away from the shoreline.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

    This rough road winds its way through foothills near the Khalkist
Mountains which lay to the west. Lush, flat plains extend to the east and
northeast. These hills are green, dotted by the occasional dark grey
boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or
civilization can be seen in sight, as there are few footprints and no wagon
ruts on this rugged road.

    The path winds slowly through the hills. There is hardly any sign of
wildlife. It is almost like the animals have been frightened off by some
great evil. The path leads north into hillier regions while also leading
south to softer ground.

    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western

    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of

an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

    Dark gray walls climb to the ceiling of this massive stalagmite.
Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural
wonderland.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

[36mThe Den of the Armaboros[0;37m
    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

    Mud puddles line a path, leading directly into the back of a giant
dragon's mouth. A small opening is easily visible between the skull and the
mandible. The mud here has a strange sweet smell that is surprisingly
pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem
terrifyingly bigger than the ones seen above. Most of the hoofprints seem
to be leading east, where the mud gets thicker.

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

    Viscous streams of the sweet-smelling, orange-tan mud spills forth from
an unseen source above. The result is an absolutely absurd amount of mud in
this room. Looking down, huge body prints have been cast where armaboros
have spent their time recuperating energy. The path to the west looks a
little bit easier to move in, since, here, you are forced to swim.

    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area
below.

    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

sweet-smelling mud. Thankfully, the path provides relief from the messy
mud-covered entrance of the stalagmite. Cloved prints pockmark the path,
too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room. The
path through the den leads to the east.

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural

Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below

[35mThe Halls of Myth[0;37m
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the

near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.
