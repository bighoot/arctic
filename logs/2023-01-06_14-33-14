major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. There is always someone
wandering around this path, be it the occasional farmer or group of

    This well-trod path through Que-teh Village allows easy access to the
few larger and more populated tents of the encampment. It also provides the
major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. There is always someone
wandering around this path, be it the occasional farmer or group of
children playing contentedly. However, the threat of the dragonarmy looms
over the village at all times, and there is an underlying air of constant

room. The lighting is provided by small, rustic lanterns hung upon each of
the tent's four main support poles. The central support pole is rather
large and carved with intricate runes from top to bottom, portraying the
hunt of some great, mystical beast. A bedroll rests on the floor of the

    You are standing in the middle of a dark, cozy tent. Thick, neatly
trimmed furs of numerous beasts serve as carpeting for this quaint little
room. The lighting is provided by small, rustic lanterns hung upon each of
the tent's four main support poles. The central support pole is rather
large and carved with intricate runes from top to bottom, portraying the
hunt of some great, mystical beast. A bedroll rests on the floor of the
southeast corner of the tent, surrounded by books. Stacks of books and

[36mA Path Around Que-teh Village[0;37m
    As you step past the first few tents, Que-teh village takes form.
Numerous tents of varying sizes can be seen in all directions. While on the
surface this village appears to be somewhat permanent, closer inspection
reveals that if desired the Que-teh could easily break camp and move to a
more fertile landscape. To the north lies the exit to Que-teh village,
while to the east and west a circular path winds through the village.

some made with paints, some simply carved into the earth. This place has

    This room has little adornment with the exception of the tribal banners
and a few small trophies. To the north lies the quarters of Stormwind,
Que-teh chieftain. Three massive guards stand watch like eagles, their eyes
scanning every inch of their lord's home. Somehow you doubt they will
readily let you see the Chieftain or his family.

    This well-trod path through Que-teh Village allows easy access to the
few larger and more populated tents of the encampment. It also provides the
major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. There is always someone
wandering around this path, be it the occasional farmer or group of
children playing contentedly. To the north you see the entrance to a very
large tent, possibly the home of the Que-teh tribal leader.

    As you step past the first few tents, Que-teh village takes form.
Numerous tents of varying sizes can be seen in all directions. While on the
surface this village appears to be somewhat permanent, closer inspection
reveals that if desired the Que-teh could easily break camp and move to a
more fertile landscape. To the north lies the exit to Que-teh village,
while to the east and west a circular path winds through the village.

You can't split 21 evenly among the people in the room; splitting 20 instead.
You divide 20 coins equally among the group members present.

[36mOutside the Shaman's Tent[0;37m
    Slightly separated from the main portion of the village is a small
clearing occuppied only by a single tribesman. Sitting in the middle of a
vast dirt circle sits one of the oldest tribesmen you have seen yet. He
sits in the circle of what appears to be hundreds upon thousands of
intricately carved runes and symbols, some made by finely fitted stones,
some made with paints, some simply carved into the earth. This place has
obvious spiritual signifigance to the people of the Que-teh tribe.

[36mA Path Through the Que-teh Village[0;37m
    This well-trod path through Que-teh Village allows easy access to the
few larger and more populated tents of the encampment. It also provides the
major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. There is always someone
wandering around this path, be it the occasional farmer or group of
children playing contentedly. However, the threat of the dragonarmy looms
over the village at all times, and there is an underlying air of constant
alert.

[36mThe Tent of Oakheart, Que-teh Historian[0;37m
    This tent is kept brightly lit by crude lanterns hung from its support
poles. Lying about the room are the writings of various Que-teh
historians, dating back to the Great Cataclysm. The markings on this tent
denote it as the dwelling place of a man of great power in the Que-teh
village. Nestled at the foot of Oakheart's bedroll, you see a small steel
strongbox.
