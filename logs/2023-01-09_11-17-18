    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    The narrow cobbled lane leads east-west towards the main town squares.
Old houses loom above you, casting shadows that dance and seem to follow
your movements. The occasional rat scurries away in your presence. To the
north you see an old well house, possibly the oldest building in this
section of town.

    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    The room is neat and orderly, more spacious than the other rooms on
this floor. A square green rug covers a large area in the center of the
office. Atop the rug sits an ornate cedar desk neatly stacked with official

arranged in front. Off to the west lies a small cot that doesn't appear to
have been slept in much.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor

    From this vantage point atop the small hill, you can see the top of
King's road extending far to the west for what seems like an eternity. The
road west is completely useless now, having been destroyed during the
Cataclysm. It now stands like a behemoth in the barren wasteland that is
the Plains of Dust. It is now a relic that serves as a harsh reminder that
even the mightiest can fall. A rocky trail from the north leads down the
hill, following King's Road at its base. An unfragmented section of the
road remains intact, and can be accessed from this point leading east into
the forests of Silvanesti, however that road is free of wagon tracks and
hoof prints, no doubt believing the tales of horrifying nightmares that
have befallen the once great nation.

    King's Road was once a grand elevated highway which was supported
by large pillars thirty feet in the air running on pillars for 600 miles
from Thon-Thalas in the east to Purstal in the west. Originally molded from
stone by House Mason of the Silvanesti Elves as a means to travel from
Silvanesti, through the Plains of Dust and into Qualinesti, it was widely
used by merchants and travelers, however during the Cataclysm the highway
collapsed near Purstal and lies in ruins further west of that point.

    This is a dry, dusty riverbank on the Torath River. Small, dried up
shrubs line the muddy banks of this small, rushing river, and the air here
is slightly colder due to the mist from the river. Although you see no
signs of life in the river from here, several poor looking fishermen walk
along the banks with shoddy poles. The sound of rushing water hangs heavily
in the cold air, and a large wooden bridge crosses the river to the east.

[36mAt the Edge of a Small Valley[0;37m
    Skirting the edge of a dry, dusty valley, the road winds its way down
and north here. The air looks much more tumultuous to the north, as great,
howling gusts of wind offer a mere prelude to the dry Plains of Dust which
expand to the northwest. As you gaze over the contents of the valley, you
notice a small town nestled deep in the valley. Wisps of black smoke drift
lazily into the air, and signs of life become more apparant as there are
many visible footprints, not yet covered by dust.

[36mEast Road[0;37m
    The Plains of Dust surround you. Barren, rocky soil offers little
vegetation, only monotony. Icereach and the Icewall glacier cannot be seen
from this distance, though you can feel their bitter winds. This road winds
its way east to where the dust clouds that billow about the plains
diminish, and west towards the city of Tarsis. Pale white clouds hang
lazily in the air when you speak and breathe, until a strong gust of wind
destroys them. The landscape is barren and rocky, and your feet are numb
despite all efforts to protect them.

    The road continues east and west here, surrounded by the chilly
monotony of the Plains of Dust. Icy gusts of wind tear relentlessly at you
from the south as they drift violently in from the depths of the Icewall
glaciers. Dry skies expand overhead, as rain is a commodity in these
parts of Krynn. You can barely make out Tarsis, lying nestled in the heart
of the plains west from here. More dust greets you to the east.

    A jaded, frigid, azure sky expands above you, a swirling sea of cloud
and wind. Pummeling you from the south, glacial winds send clouds of dust
billowing around you. The howling winds scream into your ears and tear at
your clothes, as if rogue, elemental scavengers. Barren, rocky soil offers
little comfort from the relentless winds, and the only sign of life you can
see is deep wagon ruts on this well-travelled road, most of which seem to
be headed east to west, towards the city of Tarsis.

[36mThe Road to Tarsis[0;37m
    This, the road to Tarsis, strides boldly through the Plains of Dust,
plunging eastward through the plains and west towards the exotic city of
Tarsis. Glacial winds gust in from the south, hampering your journey. The
plains respond to these forceful winds, born in the heart of Icewall, with
incredible dust storms that constantly threaten to encroach upon Tarsis and
the roads leading to her. Very few plants have the will or tenacity to try
growing on these rocky soils, and the slightest green of a stubborn moss is
a sight for sore eyes.

    The fortified walls of Tarsis rise up from the Plains of Dust like
mighty cliffs, defiant against the cold, harsh winds, and dwarfed only by
the fifty foot towers that nearly encircle the city. The ancient city walls
have withstood the tests of time, including the Cataclysm in all of its
fiery glory. Once called Tarsis the Beautiful, the Lordcity was a bustling
sea port, whose rich commerce brought sustainability and prosperity to the
land. The city now looks as desolate as the plains that surround it.
Tempestuous winds assail the walls with endless specks of sand, causing
minimal damage to the walls, but serving as a constant reminder that
nothing can survive forever in these wastelands.
