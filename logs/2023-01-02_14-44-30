on the backwall, no line or hooks on them, apparently they need a bit of

lavish by the standards of this fish market. There are actually some
decorations on the walls, tapestries, paintings and even a flower basket.
The vegetables range from great to fair condition, but the lovely decor
makes everything look just a little bit better.

but the fruit appears to be in peak form, ripe and free from bruises.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

    The rocky bend in the mountains is a sort of valley as the taller
mountain peaks all around slope downward. Loose boulders above give an
uneasy feeling, as the mountains funnel to this portion of the road. The
only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs
are unscalable. An indication of civilization comes in the form of a thin
netting that sits along the sloped cliffside to the west, preventing much
of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such
netting to the south.

filth and trash, and the path probably hasn't been cleaned in months. More

    The central area of this large chamber is filled with lounge chairs
and sofas, looted from many different parts of the world. Each appears to
be more inviting than the last. Tall midnight blue partitions separate the
central lounge from the intimate areas near the shadowy edges of the vast
chamber. Heavy drapes of crushed black velvet hang upon the walls, but the
drapes do little to muffle the moaning sounds that hang in the air.
