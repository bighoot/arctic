[36mNear the Shore of Newsea[0;37m
    Waves from the Newsea crash onto the shoreline, sending spray of salty
water into the air. Strong gusts from the north whip at your clothes and
kick sand and water droplets into your face. From the eastern horizon to
the western horizon, all that can be seen are the waters of the Newsea.
Directly across the waters to the north you can barely make out a land mass
and a city, it must be Port o'Call. The sand along the shore becomes more
sparse to the south and a road leads away from the shoreline.

    The yellowish sands seamlessly slope into the waters of Newsea as the
waters ebb and flow along the shoreline. The sounds of the sea rhythmically
wash alongst the shore, offering a consistent melody. The caw of sea birds
can be heard before they are seen, taking off and landing atop the waters
to the west. The sandy beach leads eastwards and comes to a trailhead,
leading through some verdant rolling hills. The sky is partially cloudy,
and a drizzle of rain can be felt from time to time.

    The trail descends rapidly, the end of which can be seen leading to a
sandy shoreline. The waters of Newsea can be seen rushing onto the shore,
staining the sand with moisture. Far to the southeast, beyond the hills,
the terrain opens up into a vast desert known as the Plains of Dust. There
is almost a distinguishable line where the sands from the plains meets the
grass at the edge of the hills. The sun warms the hills, but some light
gray rain clouds can be seen moving in from the west.

wagon tracks form a depression in the trail and can be traced to the east

    A shady grove offers a cool place to rest at this intersection. The
rolling grasslands to the south extend beyond sight, running parallel to
the forest of Silvanesti. The southern tip of the Khalkist mountains lies a
great distance towards the west, and rise up like towering giants. Beyond
that, though not visible, lies the waters of New Sea. Ogre Peaks and Onyx
Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name
suggests, is home to many ogres. The land to the north is a mighty plain
known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.
Skirting the northern tip of the Silvanesti forest, the road continues east
into the lands of Khur.

The trees and foliage provide an impassable barrier to entering the forest
from here, forming a natural border with the rest of the world. To the east

    Several climates converge on the groves of trees loosely dotting the
grassy landscape here, and signs of wildlife can be seen all throughout
the area. The lush forests to the south evoke a sense of peacefulness.
Mountains line the horizon to the north and rolling deserts far to the
east, while thick tree cover to the south denotes the legendary forests of
Silvanesti. An unkempt trail lingers from moderate traffic to the east and
west.

[36mBefore an Arid Desert[0;37m
    The cruel sun beats down on the road here, cracking the dried soil.
The land here suffers badly from the unrelenting winds that blow across the
desert to the west. Lizards take shelter in the shadows of the rocks where
the sand is not hot enough to roast them, but there is no shade large
enough for larger animals. Each step sinks into the searing sand, the air
thick and hazy, each breath like drowning in lava.

[36mCrossing the Thon-Thalas River[0;37m
    The beating sun bakes the dirt road in such heat that the road has
cracked into what almost resembles cobblestones. Insects scurry across,
careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only
option is to continue either north or south.

    The road begins to narrow to the north as it grows steadily steeper.
Far in the distance, the road winds as it carves a path through the
foothills of the Khalkists. Vegetation is less sparse further up the
path, offering more sights for the arduous climb. The view to the south is
a stark contrast, as the road widens and flattens. For miles the road
continues straight with very little to see except for an expansive yellow
sea of sand.

    This narrow road winds a treacherous path through these grim foothills.
The trail is rocky and somewhat unstable, through clumps of pine trees and
the occasional hardwood, though other than that the terrain is rather
monotonous. The land is hilly, though not altogether rugged, as most of the
hillsides that comprise the area are grassy or covered with small rocks.
The jagged, violent peaks of the Khalkist Mountains sneer at you high
above to the north.

    The narrow road twists and winds around the larger foothills here.
These hills are the southern extent of the mightly Khalkist Mountains which
loom over you to the north. The peaks are such a bleak, dark grey, they
almost look charred against the sky. To the south the rocky road flattens
somewhat into more hilly foothills while those to the north only become
more treacherous and rocky. In the distance you can see faint signs of
smoke barely rising above the foothills far to the southwest.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool

near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the

[36mApproaching the Hills of Khuri-Khan[0;37m
    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

sit within a thick clay wall that runs across your vision to the north,

stretch both to the east and west from here. A road becomes distinct here
at the intersection with the track which skirts around Delphon through the
dunes. The road runs straight north to the city. Followers of Paladine who
are circumnavigating the city refuse to even look north toward the city
gates, sensing the pervasive evil in that direction. To the south lies a
beaten road through the dunes.

around the taller dunes. Occasionally, a gust of wind uncovers shards of
broken pottery that have been discarded. There is little chance that
anything of value would have fallen into the shifting sand. All that seems
to peek out of the sand is old and worn, cast off by weary travelers.

[36mBeside a Road[0;37m
    You are on the western side of a long row of sand dunes. The rows of
dunes stretch out to the east in regular sets of dips and rises which look
like a tan colored sea whose waves march to the shore in regimented lines.
A broad break in the dunes lies to the west. The break runs north and
south, and in the middle of the flat, a road is seen running toward the
city of Delphon.

at the intersection with the track which skirts around Delphon through the

are circumnavigating the city refuse to even look north toward the city
gates, sensing the pervasive evil in that direction. To the south lies a
beaten road through the dunes.

    This sandy trail flattens out as it snakes away from the dunes to the
west. To the east the makings of a road can be seen, fading away under the
constantly blowing sand but still showing signs of the careful maintenance
received during years gone by. The broken roadway is a welcome sight to
weary travelers who have made the long trek down this desert trail. Sounds
of civilization rise from the city of Delphon that rises to the northeast;
the sturdy clip-clop of shod horses' hooves resonates on the stone amid the
raucous fray from merchants, shoppers, and the guards and soldiers of the
Green Dragonarmy alike.

    Endless sand blows around you along this small trail through the desert
of Khur. To the east you can see it leads to the southern side of Delphon,
one of the few established cities in a place where the nomadic existence is
the standard way of life. Towering dunes rise to the north and south,
blocking any attempt to move in that direction; your only options are to
move eastward towards Delphon, or away from it into the desert wasteland.

about you. The constant wind is calmer here, blocked by two towering dunes
that rise to your south and west. Turning sharply to move around them, this
small trail heads north into the wastelands of Khur and east, where it
widens out on the flatter terrain. Small creatures dart about in the sand,
looking for protection from the harsh environment.

brown brush lies scattered about as you trudge through the wastelands of
Khur, but does little to break the monotony of the desert. You can see
small creatures darting about in the hot golden sand, foraging for food and
water. The path through the shifting sands runs into further wastelands to
the east, and up a large incline to the west where a large dune rises above
the surrounding mounds of sand.

The undulating waves of sand stretch as far as the eye can see to the
south; no reasons can be found to explore in that direction. To the west
one of the largest dunes around rises from the sand, far too steep to
climb. Only the hardiest desert wildlife can be found here, amid the

[36mNear the City of Delphon[0;37m
    The road begins to narrow as it heads to the east, before the looming
black iron gates of Delphon, ruled by the evil grasp of the Green
Dragonarmy. The city rises amid the sprawling desert like a shimmering
mirage, its solid clay walls standing firm against the constant attack by
the wind-blown sand. Occasionally a merchant will pass by, one of the many
filling their pockets as they fill the needs of the soldiers within
Delphon. A small path runs to the southwest of here, skirting around the
city for those who wish to avoid the pervasive evil of the Dragonarmy.

west the road seeps into the endless dunes of which this road is flanked to
both the north and the south. To the south, a small path runs through the
dunes, winding around the possible dangers of Delphon.

[36mEntering a Barren Desert[0;37m
    The open expanses of desert sands stretch out in all directions. The
barren and desolate landscape exudes a deep emptiness which is compounded
by the lack of life present. Only a few small insects and lizards roam the
sands, and a trio of birds circle in the cloudless sky high above. Some
tiny cacti litter the area and the occasional tumbleweed graces the scenery
with its presence every so often. Waves of heat emanate upwards from the
ground as the sand releases the remnant energy of the desert's sun. A
welcome cool wind breezes in from the south, acting as a guide out of the
unforgiving seas of sand.

    Cacti of all shapes and sizes are growing in this section of the
desert, with a population density that is simply astounding. There are
hundreds of cacti of every sort imaginable, from towering columns to
low-lying clusters. The colour variety is quite incredible as well
including red, green, blue, yellow and even a few white cacti. Some of them
are covered with beautiful blooming flowers further adding to the
spectacle. This is a multi-coloured desert wonder to behold, although the
maze of spiked cacti does make the area a little tricky to navigate.

have been stirred up by the commotion to the east and rise high into the

[36mThe Desolate Desert Expanse[0;37m
    This desolate portion of desert is terrifyingly empty. The ground is
completely void of any plant life, it is simply a flat sandy wasteland that
seems to go on forever. Sweltering heat has scorched the sands and
threatens to extinguish all life from the area. The despair and emptiness
of the surroundings is deafening. It feels like the desert could swallow up
any poor creature that loses its way here. Some black birds circle in the
sky high above, hoping that the desert's heat takes its toll soon, bringing
them a fresh meal.

[36mThe Shifting Sands[0;37m
    The sandy floor of the desert in this area seems to have a will of its
own, shifting and moving at its own accord. The tumultuous motion of the
sands makes movement difficult and threatens to swallow anything that
remains stationary for too long. The swift desert winds carry sand through
the air, forming small sandstorms which twirl out of control before losing
their momentum and dissipating. The desert is in a constant state of
chaotic motion here, with sand moving both underfoot and through the air.
What could cause such instability is uncertain, but there is an eerie and
unnatural feeling that lingers in this place.

[36mThe Head Archaeologist's Tent[0;37m
    The inside of this large tent is filled with dusty maps and schematics,
looking very much like the centre of the digging operation. Black dust
kicked up from the quarry excavations has coated much of the contents of
the tent, having been blown through the entrance by the desert wind that
swirls around the digsite. Covering most of the western wall is a massive
map of the quarry with a series of pins stuck in it, possibly marking where
significant finds have been made. A warm breeze blows through the opening
on the southern wall which leads back to the swelteringly hot quarry.

    The black stone perimeter of the quarry takes a sharp turn here as the
dig site hits its boundary. Deep gouges scar the stone walls from the
excavation process and chipped fragments of stone layer the floor. Dark
dust clouds kicked up by the digging activities swirl in the sky above,
which are occasionally scattered by gusts of desert wind. The temperature
in the quarry is extremely hot. The obsidian stone seems to absorb and
retain the desert's heat and radiate its energy like a huge black furnace.

    The desert sands begin to recede revealing a smooth layer of solid
black rock underneath. The black stone substance seems to radiance the
desert's heat, pushing the temperature in this area to an almost unbearable
level. A finely crafted metal fence has been constructed here to the east,
the lack of weather erosion betraying its young age. An overly elaborate
metal gate set in the fence marks the entrance to an area bustling with
activity. The distinct sounds of machinery and metal digging implements
striking stone can be heard echoing through the warm air. Large dust clouds
have been stirred up by the commotion to the east and rise high into the
air above.

[36mA Jagged Outcrop of Obsidian[0;37m
    An enormous, pitch black outcrop of obsidian stone rises out of the
desert sands. The outcrop is thickest at its base and thins as it rises
upwards to a slightly curved point, giving it the appearance of a shark's
dorsal fin slicing through the sand. Unmarred by erosion, the rock's glossy
black surface shines dully as the light catches it. A large bird's nest of
sticks and straw rests in a craggy upper section of the outcrop where the
pitch black stone acts as a windbreak to protect it from the harsh desert
winds. The obsidian stone seems to radiate heat, as if it absorbs and
retains the energy from its surroundings.

[36mA Jagged Outcrop of Obsidian[0;37m
    An enormous, pitch black outcrop of obsidian stone rises out of the
desert sands. The outcrop is thickest at its base and thins as it rises
upwards to a slightly curved point, giving it the appearance of a shark's
dorsal fin slicing through the sand. Unmarred by erosion, the rock's glossy
black surface shines dully as the light catches it. A large bird's nest of
sticks and straw rests in a craggy upper section of the outcrop where the
pitch black stone acts as a windbreak to protect it from the harsh desert
winds. The obsidian stone seems to radiate heat, as if it absorbs and
retains the energy from its surroundings.

completely void of any plant life, it is simply a flat sandy wasteland that

threatens to extinguish all life from the area. The despair and emptiness

any poor creature that loses its way here. Some black birds circle in the

completely void of any plant life, it is simply a flat sandy wasteland that
seems to go on forever. Sweltering heat has scorched the sands and
threatens to extinguish all life from the area. The despair and emptiness
of the surroundings is deafening. It feels like the desert could swallow up
any poor creature that loses its way here. Some black birds circle in the

    This desolate portion of desert is terrifyingly empty. The ground is
completely void of any plant life, it is simply a flat sandy wasteland that
seems to go on forever. Sweltering heat has scorched the sands and
threatens to extinguish all life from the area. The despair and emptiness

[36mThe Shifting Sands[0;37m
    The sandy floor of the desert in this area seems to have a will of its
own, shifting and moving at its own accord. The tumultuous motion of the
sands makes movement difficult and threatens to swallow anything that
remains stationary for too long. The swift desert winds carry sand through
the air, forming small sandstorms which twirl out of control before losing
their momentum and dissipating. The desert is in a constant state of
chaotic motion here, with sand moving both underfoot and through the air.
What could cause such instability is uncertain, but there is an eerie and
unnatural feeling that lingers in this place.

    Cacti of all shapes and sizes are growing in this section of the
desert, with a population density that is simply astounding. There are
hundreds of cacti of every sort imaginable, from towering columns to
low-lying clusters. The colour variety is quite incredible as well
including red, green, blue, yellow and even a few white cacti. Some of them
are covered with beautiful blooming flowers further adding to the
spectacle. This is a multi-coloured desert wonder to behold, although the

    Coarse desert sand blankets the area, littered with the bones of
animals who fell victim to the unrelenting sun. Powerful winds howl over
the sands surface, searching for any source of moisture to suck dry. The
occasional tumbleweed bounces along to the rhythm of the wind and a few
creatures scurry across the sands searching desperately for food, but the
harsh desert doesn't part with any such luxury easily. Cloudless skies meet
sandy dunes on every horizon as the desolate desert stretches farther than

    An enormous, pitch black outcrop of obsidian stone rises out of the
desert sands. The outcrop is thickest at its base and thins as it rises
upwards to a slightly curved point, giving it the appearance of a shark's
dorsal fin slicing through the sand. Unmarred by erosion, the rock's glossy
black surface shines dully as the light catches it. A large bird's nest of
sticks and straw rests in a craggy upper section of the outcrop where the
pitch black stone acts as a windbreak to protect it from the harsh desert
winds. The obsidian stone seems to radiate heat, as if it absorbs and
retains the energy from its surroundings.

the lack of weather erosion betraying its young age. An overly elaborate
metal gate set in the fence marks the entrance to an area bustling with
activity. The distinct sounds of machinery and metal digging implements
striking stone can be heard echoing through the warm air. Large dust clouds
have been stirred up by the commotion to the east and rise high into the

to the desert valley below. The obsidian stone ledge overhangs the valley
wall at such an angle that climbing down the cliff itself would be
impossible. The wind whistles through the area and skims over the top of

    This particularly large sand dune stands high above the desert below

stretch outwards to the horizons. A gorgeously green oasis to the far north
east looks completely out of place in the panoramic view of the harsh

quite refreshing. The beginning of a high walled city stands in the

    A large copper portcullis set in high stone walls marks the entrance to
the desert city of Khuri-Khan, home of the Khur tribe. Sporadically flying
along the city's walls are the flags and banners of the Green Dragonarmy
which gently flutter in the breeze. A dusty path passes under the
portcullis moving into the city, a few camels and horses have been tied to
stakes beside it ensuring they remain until their masters return.
Silhouettes of well clothed figures can be seen walking in the city up
ahead, their movement kicking up clouds of dust as they go about their
daily business. Scattered in the nearby vicinity are a number of dirty
canvas tents, the temporary homes of nomadic people visiting the city. A
tall sand dune rises up to the east marking the way back to the desert.

the eye easily. The humid, misty air swirls around the tent working in
tandem with the shadows to conceal the surroundings. A small fireplace
crackles in the centre of the tent and a tiny black iron pot has been
placed on top of it. As the fire licks the pot's iron, wisps of gaseous
purple smoke rise out of it and upward into the darkness. Eerie charms
constructed of animal bone and sinew hang from somewhere above, rattling
gently as the air circulates. There is an ominous feeling lingering here,
like the lost souls of the desert seek to re-enter the world of the living

[36mThe Gates of Khuri-Khan[0;37m
    A large copper portcullis set in high stone walls marks the entrance to
the desert city of Khuri-Khan, home of the Khur tribe. Sporadically flying
along the city's walls are the flags and banners of the Green Dragonarmy
which gently flutter in the breeze. A dusty path passes under the
portcullis moving into the city, a few camels and horses have been tied to
stakes beside it ensuring they remain until their masters return.
Silhouettes of well clothed figures can be seen walking in the city up
ahead, their movement kicking up clouds of dust as they go about their
daily business. Scattered in the nearby vicinity are a number of dirty
canvas tents, the temporary homes of nomadic people visiting the city. A
tall sand dune rises up to the east marking the way back to the desert.

[36mAtop a Tall Desert Dune[0;37m
    This particularly large sand dune stands high above the desert below
and the view from its peak is simply breathtaking. Tiny smatterings of
green flora blot the endless seas of sand that surround the dune and
stretch outwards to the horizons. A gorgeously green oasis to the far north
east looks completely out of place in the panoramic view of the harsh
deserts, though the splash of colour in the otherwise desolate landscape is
quite refreshing. The beginning of a high walled city stands in the
desert's sands at the base of the dune to the west.

[36mUpon the Edge of a Cliff[0;37m
    The desert sands end abruptly here, revealing solid black stone
underneath. On the eastern edge of this stone area a steep cliff gives way
to the desert valley below. The obsidian stone ledge overhangs the valley
wall at such an angle that climbing down the cliff itself would be
impossible. The wind whistles through the area and skims over the top of
the valley. The black stone cliffs retain and radiate the desert's energy,
pushing the temperature in this area to an almost unbearable level. Whilst
to the north and south the desert's sands resume their domination of the
scenery, a jagged obsidian outcrop looms large over the bleak landscape to
the west.

    This desolate portion of desert is terrifyingly empty. The ground is
completely void of any plant life, it is simply a flat sandy wasteland that
seems to go on forever. Sweltering heat has scorched the sands and
threatens to extinguish all life from the area. The despair and emptiness
of the surroundings is deafening. It feels like the desert could swallow up
any poor creature that loses its way here. Some black birds circle in the
sky high above, hoping that the desert's heat takes its toll soon, bringing
them a fresh meal.

[36mA Jagged Outcrop of Obsidian[0;37m
    An enormous, pitch black outcrop of obsidian stone rises out of the
desert sands. The outcrop is thickest at its base and thins as it rises
upwards to a slightly curved point, giving it the appearance of a shark's
dorsal fin slicing through the sand. Unmarred by erosion, the rock's glossy
black surface shines dully as the light catches it. A large bird's nest of
sticks and straw rests in a craggy upper section of the outcrop where the
pitch black stone acts as a windbreak to protect it from the harsh desert
winds. The obsidian stone seems to radiate heat, as if it absorbs and
retains the energy from its surroundings.

[36mThe Deserts of Khur[0;37m
    Coarse desert sand blankets the area, littered with the bones of
animals who fell victim to the unrelenting sun. Powerful winds howl over
the sands surface, searching for any source of moisture to suck dry. The
occasional tumbleweed bounces along to the rhythm of the wind and a few
creatures scurry across the sands searching desperately for food, but the
harsh desert doesn't part with any such luxury easily. Cloudless skies meet
sandy dunes on every horizon as the desolate desert stretches farther than
the eye can see.

[36mThe Outskirts of an Obsidian Quarry[0;37m
    The desert sands begin to recede revealing a smooth layer of solid
black rock underneath. The black stone substance seems to radiance the
desert's heat, pushing the temperature in this area to an almost unbearable
level. A finely crafted metal fence has been constructed here to the east,
the lack of weather erosion betraying its young age. An overly elaborate
metal gate set in the fence marks the entrance to an area bustling with
activity. The distinct sounds of machinery and metal digging implements
striking stone can be heard echoing through the warm air. Large dust clouds
have been stirred up by the commotion to the east and rise high into the
air above.

    Cacti of all shapes and sizes are growing in this section of the
desert, with a population density that is simply astounding. There are
hundreds of cacti of every sort imaginable, from towering columns to
low-lying clusters. The colour variety is quite incredible as well
including red, green, blue, yellow and even a few white cacti. Some of them
are covered with beautiful blooming flowers further adding to the
spectacle. This is a multi-coloured desert wonder to behold, although the
maze of spiked cacti does make the area a little tricky to navigate.

[36mEntering a Barren Desert[0;37m
    The open expanses of desert sands stretch out in all directions. The
barren and desolate landscape exudes a deep emptiness which is compounded
by the lack of life present. Only a few small insects and lizards roam the
sands, and a trio of birds circle in the cloudless sky high above. Some
tiny cacti litter the area and the occasional tumbleweed graces the scenery
with its presence every so often. Waves of heat emanate upwards from the
ground as the sand releases the remnant energy of the desert's sun. A
welcome cool wind breezes in from the south, acting as a guide out of the
unforgiving seas of sand.

Khur, but does little to break the monotony of the desert. You can see
small creatures darting about in the hot golden sand, foraging for food and
water. The path through the shifting sands runs into further wastelands to
the east, and up a large incline to the west where a large dune rises above
the surrounding mounds of sand.

occasional dik-dik or roadrunner darts across the wastes, and you catch a
glimpse of a hyena lurking in the shadows of the dune to your north.

[36mMoving Around the Dunes[0;37m
    You plod along in the desert sand, with little change in the scenery
about you. The constant wind is calmer here, blocked by two towering dunes
that rise to your south and west. Turning sharply to move around them, this
small trail heads north into the wastelands of Khur and east, where it
widens out on the flatter terrain. Small creatures dart about in the sand,
looking for protection from the harsh environment.

[36mMoving Across the Sand[0;37m
    Endless sand blows around you along this small trail through the desert
of Khur. To the east you can see it leads to the southern side of Delphon,
one of the few established cities in a place where the nomadic existence is
the standard way of life. Towering dunes rise to the north and south,
blocking any attempt to move in that direction; your only options are to
move eastward towards Delphon, or away from it into the desert wasteland.

[36mBefore A Road[0;37m
    This sandy trail flattens out as it snakes away from the dunes to the
west. To the east the makings of a road can be seen, fading away under the
constantly blowing sand but still showing signs of the careful maintenance
received during years gone by. The broken roadway is a welcome sight to
weary travelers who have made the long trek down this desert trail. Sounds
of civilization rise from the city of Delphon that rises to the northeast;
the sturdy clip-clop of shod horses' hooves resonates on the stone amid the
raucous fray from merchants, shoppers, and the guards and soldiers of the
Green Dragonarmy alike.

    You are in the middle of a wide break in the rolling dunes which
stretch both to the east and west from here. A road becomes distinct here
at the intersection with the track which skirts around Delphon through the
dunes. The road runs straight north to the city. Followers of Paladine who
are circumnavigating the city refuse to even look north toward the city
gates, sensing the pervasive evil in that direction. To the south lies a
beaten road through the dunes.

alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on
the Blood Sea northeast of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder

wooden poles loosely tied together without any other form of windbreak or
insulation applied to them, allowing the chilly ocean wind to rush through.
The poles supporting the roof are rotting away as is the grass thatching on
top of it, leaving large holes where there is nothing to keep out the

quagmire of mud and, from the smell of it, excrement and rotting food.
Around the perimeter are large bundles of animal hides, probably blankets

The poles supporting the roof are rotting away as is the grass thatching on
top of it, leaving large holes where there is nothing to keep out the

    The road follows along the contours of the craggy cliffside. Greener
pastures with small wildflowers and several small hills are lining one side
of the road. On the other side the Blood Sea is crashing along the rocky
coastline. A bustling village can be seen the distance further along the
Endscape Peninsula.

    As the waves crash on the rocky coastline, the spray reaches this part
of the road, creating a light mist. The small village of Dragon's Point is
nearby, and the smell of raw fish is overtaking the air. The road slopes up
a small hill as it nears the shoreline. The coast is very rocky, making any
ability to venture into the waters of the rough Blood Sea near impossible.

    The large green trees lining the road are swaying softly in the cool
breeze. The road is well maintained as it follows along the shoreline of
the Blood Sea. The village of Dragon's Point was built on the tip of a
peninsula and several boats can be seen on the horizon, sailing around the
village. The ocean mist holds the smell of fish and salty air, making it
very pungent. The beginnings of the lush northern forests of the Endscape
Peninsula can barely be seen from this vantage point.

Several boats can be seen sailing around the harbor and in the shallow
waters of the Blood Sea. The bay is not as violent as other parts of the
coast and the waters are quite calm. The landscape is lush and dark green
from the humidity of the marine layer. Several pastures and hills have
vibrant colorful wildflowers growing on them.

    The road passes through the outskirts of Dragon's Point as it heads
deeper into Kern. Now dilapidated and in disrepair, several homes were once
built on the outer pastures. The bustling village only exists because of
the extensive fishing trade from the Blood Sea. It is built on a tip of a
peninsula around a small harbor and cove. Several small fishing boats can
be seen floating in the nearby waters. The air reeks of rotted fish and it
is why many outsiders will not come to visit..

Kern. It is surrounded by small coves and a vast rocky coastline. The fish
trade is the heart of the village and everything they do revolves around
it. All members of the community either fish or contribute to the industry
to keep their village thriving. The sea is much calmer as the waves lightly
crash on the shores.

    The foot traffic is relatively light in the center of the village. A
small stone water fountain is the central point of the square and there is
a large official-looking building that appears to be better maintained than
the other buildings in the rest of the village. Loud merry sounds echo from
a nearby tavern, which is the major gathering point for most of the
villagers when they are not out fishing. A large flag pole has been erected
in front of the town hall.

have been built between the large warehouses, one towards an area of the

of fish drying on them. The smell is far worse here and any breeze carrying

    To the west the docks of Dragon's Point can be seen, a speck of
civilization amonst the wild grasslands. Pink-white foam spins in
uncontrolled spirals, driven by the waves and the winds whipping from the
sanguine sea, creating fleeting patterns of cerise bubbles. These waters,
poisoned by the death and daring of the Cataclysm, have been stained as red
as blood, with a high salt content which makes it seem almost as thick, as
well. Dyed by the crimson waters, massive colonies of kelp float a few feet
beneath the surface, striped with sable and magenta, appropriately known as
bloodwrack.

    To the north the tall pines of the Dancing Woods tower over the
Nightmare Sea. Deep beneath the surface of the Blood Sea dark shapes can be
seen flitting perilously among the submerged castles and keeps which once
dotted the Istarian countryside. The waters feel unnaturally thick, like
clotted blood, and the air seems preternaturally humid and heavy, as if the
weight of the souls of those drowned below somehow drags the very ether
downwards. Driven by the sempiternal tempest at the center of the waves,
the winds howl in hideous lament, mourning the wrath of the gods and
weeping at the arrogance of man.

[36mThe Blood Sea of Istar[0;37m
    The waters become more treacherous south of Saifhum. These waters,
poisoned by the death and daring of the Cataclysm, have been stained as red
as blood, with a high salt content which makes it seem almost as thick, as
well. Dyed by the crimson waters, massive colonies of kelp float a few feet
beneath the surface, striped with sable and magenta, appropriately known as
bloodwrack. Deep beneath the surface of the Blood Sea dark shapes can be
seen flitting perilously among the submerged castles and keeps which once
dotted the Istarian countryside.

    The shoreline and thick canopy of the Dancing Woods can be seen to the
west of the sea. Driven by the sempiternal tempest at the center of the
waves, the winds howl in hideous lament, mourning the wrath of the gods and
weeping at the arrogance of man. Glowering with repugnant fury, a
gargantuan black cloud lies in the very middle of the waters, darkening the
sherried waves to an atramentous burgundy. The bracing smell of the salt
air is undercut by the unmistakable odor of decay from within the forlorn
ocean, the perfume of loss and hubris leaving an indelible mark upon the
senses.

[36mNearing a Rocky Island[0;37m
     Ominous dark waters churn all around you, making a loud roaring noise.
A few sickly-yellow clumps of kelp have floated to the surface of the
water, and are now subject to the thrashing of the waves. Seagulls and
other birds fly overhead, occasionally swooping down to pick up their food.
Looking westward, you see some jagged cliffs rising up from the beachhead
of the island. Once known to be uninhabited, it is now rumoured that
pirates have taken over the island and made it their base of operations. If
it were indeed inhabited by pirates, it would prove to be a profitable
adventure. Legends about the wealth of the pirates in the blood sea area
are known all over Krynn.

[36mShallow Waters[0;37m
     Much as you would expect, very few fishermen frequent these waters,
and those that do must be quite desperate to risk life and limb this far
away from civilization. The water here is calm, and fish can be seen
darting beneath the blood-red tinted waters. To the west lies a small
natural bay. Eastward lies more of the waters of the Blood Sea, named after
the myth that the sea is red with the blood of the innocents who died
during the Cataclysm.

     Wind pummels your body as you try to climb the treacherous sea cliff.
The cliff's face has been worn rather smooth with time, leaving the shabby
handholds few and quite far between. Far below you lies the sandy crimson
beach of the believed-to-be uninhabited island. A hundred yards or so above
your current position is the cliff top, and with a little luck, ingenuity,
and perseverance, you should make it there.

     You are atop a dangerous and quite treacherous looking cliff. The
beach is some three to four hundred feet below you, and since you don't
feel like pursuing a career as hamburger meat, you tend to stay away from
the edge. All around your northern and eastern sides is a plateau top, with
a path running around the perimeter. Off in the distance, you are able to
see a massive lighthouse that looks like it has been standing since before
the Cataclysm. Rumors of pirates abound in these areas, so you stay on your
guard as you walk along.

     This lazy path runs all around the perimeter of the sea cliff, giving
you a bird's eye view of what is going on far below, which appears to be
little. The view is quite breathtaking and picturesque from here. Looking
north, you see a massive light house, still operated to guide the pirates
into shore safely. Short grasses and patches of flowers frequent the ground
and alongside the path. Looking down to the dirty path itself, you see
hundreds of hoof prints, more than likely from patrolling guards.

a sudden turn, and widened into what once must have been a road. Battered

cemented them to the road. The path leads further on to a massive stone
lighthouse, rising far above the surface of the plateau.

stone. The lighthouse juts far into the skyline, rising several hundred
feet from the plateau. Several small openings are spaced equidistant from
each other, helping to illuminate the interior of the lighthouse at any
time of day. Lichen plague the surface of the rough rock surface, further
testament to how long the lighthouse has withstood the test of time. A set
of massive doors, made from solid oak, block the only entrance into the
lighthouse. Looking far above, you make out reflections from the mirrors
atop the lighthouse. It appears that even in this day and age, the
lighthouse is in use.

     You are less than five hundred paces from the lighthouse. From this
distance, you are able to clearly see just how big the lighthouse is, and
moreover, what kind of condition it is in. For having purportedly survived
the Cataclysm, it looks to be in near pristine condition. As you walk
closer towards the lighthouse and change your angle, you see reflections
bouncing off of the large mirrors atop the lighthouse, proving that indeed
it is still in use. The thought of who, or possibly even what, lives in
side sends chills deep down your spine.

[36mNearing the Lighthouse[0;37m
     You are less than five hundred paces from the lighthouse. From this
distance, you are able to clearly see just how big the lighthouse is, and
moreover, what kind of condition it is in. For having purportedly survived
the Cataclysm, it looks to be in near pristine condition. As you walk
closer towards the lighthouse and change your angle, you see reflections
bouncing off of the large mirrors atop the lighthouse, proving that indeed
it is still in use. The thought of who, or possibly even what, lives in
side sends chills deep down your spine.

[36mA Hidden Path[0;37m
     You are now walking along an overgrown path, barely visible to the
unaided eye. There are very few signs of traffic on this path, which leads
south to the lighthouse and east to yet another cliff. Seagulls circle
lazily above you, their cries of hunger piercing the crimson sky. It
appears as if someone has taken great pains to hide this path and whatever
it may lead to, for reasons you aren't quite sure of.

[36mBefore the Lighthouse[0;37m
     You stand immediately before an ancient lighthouse, made of rough-hewn
stone. The lighthouse juts far into the skyline, rising several hundred
feet from the plateau. Several small openings are spaced equidistant from
each other, helping to illuminate the interior of the lighthouse at any
time of day. Lichen plague the surface of the rough rock surface, further
testament to how long the lighthouse has withstood the test of time. A set
of massive doors, made from solid oak, block the only entrance into the
lighthouse. Looking far above, you make out reflections from the mirrors
atop the lighthouse. It appears that even in this day and age, the
lighthouse is in use.

[36mNearing the Lighthouse[0;37m
     The once lazy path that went along the perimeter of the sea cliff took
a sudden turn, and widened into what once must have been a road. Battered
cobblestones line the path, chipped and broken out of the mortar that
cemented them to the road. The path leads further on to a massive stone
lighthouse, rising far above the surface of the plateau.

     This lazy path runs all around the perimeter of the sea cliff, giving
you a bird's eye view of what is going on far below, which appears to be
little. The view is quite breathtaking and picturesque from here. Looking
north, you see a massive light house, still operated to guide the pirates
into shore safely. Short grasses and patches of flowers frequent the ground
and alongside the path. Looking down to the dirty path itself, you see
hundreds of hoof prints, more than likely from patrolling guards.

[36mEdge of a Treacherous Cliff[0;37m
     You are atop a dangerous and quite treacherous looking cliff. The
beach is some three to four hundred feet below you, and since you don't
feel like pursuing a career as hamburger meat, you tend to stay away from
the edge. All around your northern and eastern sides is a plateau top, with
a path running around the perimeter. Off in the distance, you are able to
see a massive lighthouse that looks like it has been standing since before
the Cataclysm. Rumors of pirates abound in these areas, so you stay on your
guard as you walk along.

up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds

The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the

    You are on a narrow trail that cuts between large fields of grain and
the huge vallenwood trees that cover the Solace Vale. Stretching out to the
north, these fields are known as Nearfields to the citizens of Solace
because of their proximity to the small town. A thick forest of pine trees
lies to the west, beyond which the Crystalmir Lake can be seen. To the east
this dirt trail merges with a wide road.

sharpened and pitted by the elements. Waves crash loudly against the stone

shallow pools of water and dark crevasses lie in the shadows, between
fallen slabs of rock and underneath dark overhangs cloaking parts of the
rocks in deep shadow. Tiny lifeforms swirl about in the pools, awaiting the
next high tide to free them from their shallow prisons. A large overhang
has produced a natural shelter to the east of you here, protecting its
inhabitants somewhat from the cool winds that blow off the Sirrion Sea from

the small cracks in the rocky mounds, bringing with it an unusual musky
odour.

     A natural pathway leads between two high walls of fallen stone by the
entrance to this bay in the Sirrion Sea, which you can hear battering
against the stone to the north. A large rock has fallen horizontally across
two huge boulders to the west, forming a natural shelter to the west. The
occasional small pebble falls down from above, leading you to believe some
kind of animal may be scouting around in the rocks above for food. The path
curves to the north, where it seems to terminate in a wall of a rock.

[36mAt the Base of the Rockpile[0;37m
     All around the overlapping slabs of rock and boulders have piled up to
surround you, forming a relatively sheltered corridor that leads back off
to the south and then under a large overhanging slab. The sea winds whistle
here as they blow relentlessly through several small weathered cracks in
the rock pile, these same cracks allowing in a slight dribble of foamy
seawater occasionally when the tide smashes with enough force against the
far side of the natural barrier. Several well positioned slabs of rock
would allow you to traverse to higher ground here, if you took the
necessary care with your footing.

[36mClimbing the Rockpile[0;37m
     Upon entering the top of the rockpile you are immediately struck by
the intensity of the winds blowing against the rocky barrier. A small gap
in two soaring boulders allow the wind to howl through them, creating a
high pitched whistling sound. Sea spray cascades through the gap in time to
the sound of the waves bashing against the remainder of its unseen face,
covering you in a light spray of salty water. A single huge slab has fallen
to lay horizontally atop several other tall boulders to the southwest,
creating a covered shelter underneath, and a large platform above - exposed
to much of the natural light, yet still protected from the fierce winds and
a majority of the spray.

[36mClimbing the Rockpile[0;37m
     Upon entering the top of the rockpile you are immediately struck by
the intensity of the winds blowing against the rocky barrier. A small gap
in two soaring boulders allow the wind to howl through them, creating a
high pitched whistling sound. Sea spray cascades through the gap in time to
the sound of the waves bashing against the remainder of its unseen face,
covering you in a light spray of salty water. A single huge slab has fallen
to lay horizontally atop several other tall boulders to the southwest,
creating a covered shelter underneath, and a large platform above - exposed
to much of the natural light, yet still protected from the fierce winds and
a majority of the spray.

reaching up to touch the horizon at the entrance to the bay, the peculiar
formation reminding you of the sharp teeth of a ferocious predator. The

the stone.

     All around the overlapping slabs of rock and boulders have piled up to
surround you, forming a relatively sheltered corridor that leads back off
to the south and then under a large overhanging slab. The sea winds whistle
here as they blow relentlessly through several small weathered cracks in
the rock pile, these same cracks allowing in a slight dribble of foamy
seawater occasionally when the tide smashes with enough force against the
far side of the natural barrier. Several well positioned slabs of rock
would allow you to traverse to higher ground here, if you took the
necessary care with your footing.

occasional small pebble falls down from above, leading you to believe some

A small pool of water near the entrance ripples with the fallen spray sent
from the waves crashing against the barrier, the excess slowly draining off
over the eastern edge back into the sea. To the north and west tall jagged
shards of stone stand in defiance to the ravages of the elements, weakening
the waves considerably before they enter the bay. The wind whistles through

fallen slabs of rock and underneath dark overhangs cloaking parts of the
rocks in deep shadow. Tiny lifeforms swirl about in the pools, awaiting the
next high tide to free them from their shallow prisons. A large overhang
has produced a natural shelter to the east of you here, protecting its
inhabitants somewhat from the cool winds that blow off the Sirrion Sea from

     Progress along the narrow defile is difficult, you are forced to turn
and sidestep in parts to continue. The sheer granite walls soar high above
allowing only a thin strip of sky to be visible, casting much of the valley
in shadow. Off to the west you can hear the unmistakable sound of the sea
crashing against a breakwater, while the trail you follow at the base of
the defile turns to the north.

on all sides, bar south, which are so steep as to be impossible to climb. A
series of strange looking stones lies heaped up against the eastern side of

which quickly disappears amongst the sheer walls that rise high above you.

shallow pools of water and dark crevasses lie in the shadows, between
fallen slabs of rock and underneath dark overhangs cloaking parts of the
rocks in deep shadow. Tiny lifeforms swirl about in the pools, awaiting the
next high tide to free them from their shallow prisons. A large overhang
has produced a natural shelter to the east of you here, protecting its
inhabitants somewhat from the cool winds that blow off the Sirrion Sea from

Many small barnacles cling to the rock in grim defiance of the elements,
and several dried wispy strands of seaweed stuck to a small ledge above you
indicates that the waters can indeed rise suddenly in the fierce storms
which must batter this part of the coastline. Back to the south and east

     The winds slacken and the water seems to calm a little in this corner
of the bay, a combination of the shelter afforded by the rocky outcrop to
the northwest of you and the thick growth of seaweed visible just under the
surface of the water. The shore laps gently against the rocky patch of
shore to the east, while some ledges not immediately visible amongst the
shadows in the rocks to the west could possible allow you to climb and
reach higher ground. The solemn face of the sheer cliff looms above the
beaches, depriving large portions of the shore of any direct natural light.

     Large stones of varying sizes litter the white sands, gradually
growing in density and height until it forms an impassable barrier of rock
to the north and west. Small crabs scuttle among shallow pools of water
formed at the bases of some of the larger stones, which provide valuable
protection for some of the smaller life forms on the beach. From this angle
looking over the bay the murky stillness of the waters to the west is
ominously apparent, a sharp contrast to the waves in the southern reaches
of the bay, which appear more animated.

     The white sands of the beach spread out underneath you, compressed and
darkened where the waters have recently lapped against them. Small chunks
of wood can be seen buried lightly in the soft sands, their long travels on
the currents having finally deposited them here at some stage during the
last high tide. The telltale tracks of many seabirds cross all over the
beach, marking where they have recently been scouting for food. Small
shrubs have taken root at the base of the tall cliffs soaring above you to
the east, their spindly branches having sustained many months of the
battering winds coming in off the Sirrion Sea from the west.

     Almost bleached in appearance, the striking white sands continue
along the eastern shore of the bay, gradually curving to the south behind a
large pile of accumulated driftwood. A sheer rock wall overlooks the bay
from the east, stubbornly resisting both the harsh sea elements and any
attempt to climb its unyielding granite countenance. The waves lap quietly
against the sands, bringing with it the occasional scrap of seaweed
destined to either rot on the beach or be swallowed up by the tides on the
next cycle of the moons. Off in the distance the rough waters of the
Sirrion Sea continue to batter against the rocky barrier unrelentingly, the
echoes of their struggles reverberating off the high cliffs.

     A large pile of wood has accumulated in the corner of the bay, washed
up on the shore by the tides. Some of the trunks have been hollowed out,
while others have been broken and shattered by their travels, laying by the
waters to decay. Mixed in amongst the logs are the occasional hewn and
oiled plank, perhaps part of the ruin of an unfortunate sea faring vessel.
Several spindly shrubs have sprouted through the rear of the pile,
stretching out feebly for the natural light denied in the shadows of the
high cliffs surrounding the bay.

raging nearby.

     The tunnel opens out into a small cavern, no other exits visible
besides the way you came from the south. The floor seems to ripple
strangely, and after a second glance you notice it is not solid ground at
all - but a solid interwoven mat of seaweed, covering what must be a body
of water judging from the undulations on the surface. A sickly green glow
illuminates the area, emanating from several points under the living floor,
seeming to float idly from place to place and casting shadows crazily
against the damp stone walls.

[36mDescending into the Underwater Rift[0;37m
     The bay disappears above the edge of the crevasse as you descend, the
shadows intensifying and the waters growing noticeably colder. The waters
are devoid of any schools of fish, only the occasional strand of seaweed
that have become caught on one of the many jagged pieces of stone
projecting out of the crevasse walls. Occasionally you see tiny bubbles
emerge from the depths below, to drift past you in their rush toward the
surface.

     You find yourself deep within a rift in the ocean floor, the surface
represented far above by a small jagged tear of light in the surrounding
darkness. Spread out below you many wrecks litter the base of the rift - a
panorama of nautical failure. The flimsier of the vessels have long since
rotted and disintegrated, leaving only fragments to contribute to the pile.
More recent debris litters the fringes of the mound, laying to rest after
having tumbled in from above, beyond which the shadows seem to linger
momentarily, resolving themselves to be passages in each direction.

     The walls drift out of sight to either side and you look around to
find yourself in a large underwater cavern. The floor is rocky and uneven,
swathed in shadow and crossed with narrow trenches, ample cover for any
beast that might want to remain concealed. Huge shards of stone project
from the ceiling of the cavern in places, at times almost reaching the
floor some several dozen feet below. A small hole in the southern end of
the cavern leads off to a smaller chamber, in which there appears to be
some kind of light source.

     The walls drift out of sight to either side and you look around to
find yourself in a large underwater cavern. The floor is rocky and uneven,
swathed in shadow and crossed with narrow trenches, ample cover for any
beast that might want to remain concealed. Huge shards of stone project
from the ceiling of the cavern in places, at times almost reaching the
floor some several dozen feet below. A small hole in the southern end of
the cavern leads off to a smaller chamber, in which there appears to be
some kind of light source.

     This chamber was once obviously above water, with the rotted remains
of heavy tapestries still stubbornly clinging to the portions of wall which
have not collapsed and sunk into the pile of rubble. Shattered planks and
rotted beams lie amongst the stone, presumably the remains of several hard
wooden benches that once faced the intact obsidian altar resting against
the northern wall. A bas-relief serpent has been carved into a panel raised
above the altar, a large crack running down the middle.

[36mIn an Underwater Cavern[0;37m
     The walls drift out of sight to either side and you look around to
find yourself in a large underwater cavern. The floor is rocky and uneven,
swathed in shadow and crossed with narrow trenches, ample cover for any
beast that might want to remain concealed. Huge shards of stone project
from the ceiling of the cavern in places, at times almost reaching the
floor some several dozen feet below. A small hole in the southern end of
the cavern leads off to a smaller chamber, in which there appears to be
some kind of light source.

[36mBefore a Hole in the Rift[0;37m
     The floor of the underwater rift drops away into below, leaving a
gaping hole that descends further into the murky depths. A vast overhang of
stone looms above, joining with the sheer stone walls of the rift. Wreckage
from sunken sea vessels litter the slab to the west up to its very edge,
leading you to believe that even more debris has fallen into this yawning
abyss. Deep in the hole below you see a light glowing dimly, and you catch
a glimpse of movement.

     You find yourself deep within a rift in the ocean floor, the surface
represented far above by a small jagged tear of light in the surrounding
darkness. Spread out below you many wrecks litter the base of the rift - a
panorama of nautical failure. The flimsier of the vessels have long since
rotted and disintegrated, leaving only fragments to contribute to the pile.
More recent debris litters the fringes of the mound, laying to rest after
having tumbled in from above, beyond which the shadows seem to linger
momentarily, resolving themselves to be passages in each direction.

     The bay disappears above the edge of the crevasse as you descend, the
shadows intensifying and the waters growing noticeably colder. The waters
are devoid of any schools of fish, only the occasional strand of seaweed
that have become caught on one of the many jagged pieces of stone
projecting out of the crevasse walls. Occasionally you see tiny bubbles
emerge from the depths below, to drift past you in their rush toward the
surface.

turbulence of the fierce currents surrounding the column. Jagged rocks rise
up out of the sea floor, and several timber beams lie wedged between them,
left until they rot enough to break and drift free. The noise of what must
be the breakers slapping against the sides of the column can be heard
loudly, a slow rhythmic oscillation of white noise.

patches covered with a thick coating of slime. The southern end terminates
at a large iron gate, behind which you can hear the roaring of the waves as
they crash into the exterior of the column. The corridor trails off to the
north for a few dozen feet and then ends in a solid wall of stone, which is
pockmarked with small indentations as if a strong acid had been splashed
around.

[36mInside the Stone Column[0;37m
     You find yourself in a small tunnel hollowed out of the stone. The
walls are smooth and dry, at odds with the sound of the waves crashing
against the outside of the column far in the distance, reduced to a distant
murmur. The tunnel opens up into a large chamber to the west, while the
east terminates in a rough stone slab that looks to have collapsed from the
ceiling, perhaps caused by an earthquake or the like.

[36mA Cold Stone Chamber[0;37m
     A large chamber has been somehow hollowed out of the stone column, its
smooth walls soaring up and terminating in the huge square slab that serves
as the ceiling. The only openings appear in the east and north walls, where
tunnels lead off into darkness underneath archways carved with the likeness
of vines. Despite that it must be in close proximity to the ocean waters
this chamber is completely dry, allowing a thick layer of dust to build up
on the floor.

     Thick healthy looking vines and ferns frow around the walls, framing a
clear pond of water against the northern wall of the chamber. The floor is
covered with a thick layer of feathers and bird excrement, evidence of what
must be untold years of habitation by the avian life in the bay. A vine
covered column of stone stretches up through the centre of the room where
it joins with the stalactite encrusted ceiling high above. You can see
several openings in the stone above which allow precious sunlight to feed
the plant life here during the sunlight hours, though simply too high to
attempt to reach.

     A cramped alcove has been hollowed out from the column of stone in the
same technique as around the rest of this unusual structure. The walls are
smooth and cold, and damp in places from the trails of water that streams
down from an opening in the ceiling. Handholds have been expertly carved
into the walls, allowing you to climb up to, and you imagine beyond, this
dark opening. A small break in the eastern wall allows you to leave back
out to the mercy of the elements.

dirt and stone falling below. Fresh air flows in from above, bringing with
it the scent of salt and the sounds of the many gulls circling the rocks
outside in the bay. A large dark stain covers the stone around the
handholds in one place, surrounded by smaller spatters, resembling blood
that has been spilt and left to congeal on the wall.

circle around the depression, their weathered granite faces bearing the
faint remnants of intricately etched runes. Three slabs of rock stand side
by side to the north, leaving only a small gap between them. A slight dip
at the top of the depression to the east opens up to a grand view of the
bay far below, reinforcing the fact of how high you are above solid ground
and how easy it would be to fall to your death upon the sharp rocks
surrounding this huge peak jutting out of the ocean.

[36mAn Alcove in the Column[0;37m
     Concealed behind a jutting ledge, this cold alcove is sheltered from
the gales raging just outside. A large pile of sticks and small shrubs rest
against the far corner, their thin trunks apparently ripped violently from
the ground they rooted in and carried to form a nest nestled in the side of
the column. From the mounds of decaying feathers laying about the alcove
you assume that birds have been living here for a very long time.

waves visible as a white lines on the shore. The waters of the bay become
darker in the northeast corner, probably due to the masses of seaweed that
was to be seen growing densely in that area. The platform at the top of the

     You stand at the centre of a sunken depression right at the very top
of the stone column. Several large stone blocks stand positioned in a
circle around the depression, their weathered granite faces bearing the
faint remnants of intricately etched runes. Three slabs of rock stand side
by side to the north, leaving only a small gap between them. A slight dip
at the top of the depression to the east opens up to a grand view of the
bay far below, reinforcing the fact of how high you are above solid ground
and how easy it would be to fall to your death upon the sharp rocks
surrounding this huge peak jutting out of the ocean.

     The wide open waters of the Sirrion Sea give way to a faint line of
land stretching along the eastern horizon, from where you can hear the
distant roar of the surf crashing against the shoreline. Birds circle high
in the sky, tiny specks in the distance, which wheel and dive toward the
foaming crests in search of fish to dine upon. The waters stretch off into
the horizon in all other directions.

    You travel the sea lanes in the Sirrion Sea. A thin stretch of remote
coastline extends across the northern horizon, the southernmost reaches of
a forgotten isle, while the open sea opens up before you in all other
directions. Birds circle high overhead, tracing lazy arcs in the sky.

    Crashing waves reach towards the empty sky as the Sirrion Sea rushes
between the Halter Woods and Windsrun river to the east, while the shadows
of Enstar rise up to the west. The bracing smell of the salt air excites
the senses, and the wind runs rampant over the high peaks of the deep
waters. A few gulls dare the gusty blasts, cawing loudly over the roar of
the ocean.

hangs in the air with a deadly pervasiveness. The climate is perpetually
dark and gloomy and the water is blue-black, with life deep beneath the

mountains. This whole places has a forlorn and lonely feeling, spirited far
away from civilization in the corner of the Sirrion Sea. To the west the
harbor of Castle Dread peeks from between the rocks, to the northeast there
is a glimpse of the citadel of the Dread family itself, secluded in the
mountains.

    This is a large but rocky path leading to Castle Dread into the
mountains. This whole place gives a lonely and uneasy feeling. The area is
inundated with the commoners and merchants of Nostar. To the west one can
see the harbor of Castle Dread, to the northeast to get a glimpse of Castle
Dread, secluded in the mountains and vales.

easier. Close by, one can see the legendary vales, each oozing out languid

streams, even though it is impossible to see the streams or the Nostar
river from this vantage.

[36mTop of the Rocky Path  [0;37m
    This peak stands at the top of the path, providing a clear view of the
surrounding areas, including Castle Dread itself. Castle Dread is located
directly to the east, it is separated from the surrounding area by a river
of small streams created by the nearby vales that serves as an impressive
watery moat. The spray is overwhelming and almost unbearable.

[36mAt the Edge of the Cliff[0;37m
    Here there is the edge of the cliff, a few hundred feet below, one can
see the river of languid streams and waterways. Castle Dread stands
ominously in the middle of the river on a giant support undoubtedly
reinforced by ancient magic. This is where the draw bridge is raised and
lowered across the perilous streams or the Nostar river that flows below.
Attached to the surrounding mountain sides are four gigantic chains
connecting to Castle Dread and serve as additional support. One of the
chain links is connected just north of here.

[36mThe Drawbridge[0;37m
    This is the huge draw bridge that connects Castle Dread to the rest of
world. The bridge is made of some strange adamantine material that can
withstand the oxidation from the immense spray, coming from below. The huge
drawbridge is the gates to the fortress city of Castle Dread, it is
connected to a huge mechanism that raises and lowers the drawbridge. When
the drawbridge is lifted, there would be no way to enter Castle Dread from
the ground.

mountain ranges, there are also three vales that lie to the north,
northeast, and to the south. Almost like a fortress, Castle Dread itself is
directly to the east.

    The yellowish sands seamlessly slope into the waters of Newsea as the
waters ebb and flow along the shoreline. The sounds of the sea rhythmically
wash alongst the shore, offering a consistent melody. The caw of sea birds
can be heard before they are seen, taking off and landing atop the waters
to the west. The sandy beach leads eastwards and comes to a trailhead,
leading through some verdant rolling hills. The sky is partially cloudy,
and a drizzle of rain can be felt from time to time.

    The trail descends rapidly, the end of which can be seen leading to a
sandy shoreline. The waters of Newsea can be seen rushing onto the shore,
staining the sand with moisture. Far to the southeast, beyond the hills,
the terrain opens up into a vast desert known as the Plains of Dust. There
is almost a distinguishable line where the sands from the plains meets the
grass at the edge of the hills. The sun warms the hills, but some light
gray rain clouds can be seen moving in from the west.

    A shady grove offers a cool place to rest at this intersection. The
rolling grasslands to the south extend beyond sight, running parallel to
the forest of Silvanesti. The southern tip of the Khalkist mountains lies a
great distance towards the west, and rise up like towering giants. Beyond
that, though not visible, lies the waters of New Sea. Ogre Peaks and Onyx
Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name
suggests, is home to many ogres. The land to the north is a mighty plain
known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.
Skirting the northern tip of the Silvanesti forest, the road continues east

The trees and foliage provide an impassable barrier to entering the forest
from here, forming a natural border with the rest of the world. To the east
and west, a well travelled path continues east along the edge of the forest,
and west to an intersection. To the north, you can see the plains of Blode

    The trail continues to the east and west, along the edge of the Forest
of Silvanesti. The path weaves through the trees, now thicker from the
looming forests to the south. Brilliant light-rays shine down from the
dense canopy above the forest floor. Sparse foliage and a lack of downed
trees along the trail indicate this path sees some amount of traffic.
Traveling here seems peaceful and unencumbered.

    The trail continues to the east and west, along the edge of the Forest
of Silvanesti. Tall timbers line the sides of the path that creates a
quaint corridor effect. The trees seem to thin out here, giving way to a
more verdant landscape of various shrubbery. Animals trails intersect the
main path leading through the area. Mountain ranges are barely visible to
the north and to the east the terrain seems more rigid and bare. Traveling
here seems peaceful and unencumbered.

the area. The lush forests to the south evoke a sense of peacefulness.
Mountains line the horizon to the north and rolling deserts far to the

    The cruel sun beats down on the road here, cracking the dried soil.
The land here suffers badly from the unrelenting winds that blow across the
desert to the west. Lizards take shelter in the shadows of the rocks where
the sand is not hot enough to roast them, but there is no shade large
enough for larger animals. Each step sinks into the searing sand, the air
thick and hazy, each breath like drowning in lava.

[36mCrossing the Thon-Thalas River[0;37m
    The beating sun bakes the dirt road in such heat that the road has
cracked into what almost resembles cobblestones. Insects scurry across,
careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only
option is to continue either north or south.

    The road begins to narrow to the north as it grows steadily steeper.
Far in the distance, the road winds as it carves a path through the
foothills of the Khalkists. Vegetation is less sparse further up the
path, offering more sights for the arduous climb. The view to the south is
a stark contrast, as the road widens and flattens. For miles the road
continues straight with very little to see except for an expansive yellow
sea of sand.

    This narrow road winds a treacherous path through these grim foothills.
The trail is rocky and somewhat unstable, through clumps of pine trees and
the occasional hardwood, though other than that the terrain is rather
monotonous. The land is hilly, though not altogether rugged, as most of the
hillsides that comprise the area are grassy or covered with small rocks.
The jagged, violent peaks of the Khalkist Mountains sneer at you high

These hills are the southern extent of the mightly Khalkist Mountains which
loom over you to the north. The peaks are such a bleak, dark grey, they
almost look charred against the sky. To the south the rocky road flattens
somewhat into more hilly foothills while those to the north only become
more treacherous and rocky. In the distance you can see faint signs of
smoke barely rising above the foothills far to the southwest.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

    The beating sun bakes the dirt road in such heat that the road has
cracked into what almost resembles cobblestones. Insects scurry across,
careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only
option is to continue either north or south.

The land here suffers badly from the unrelenting winds that blow across the
desert to the west. Lizards take shelter in the shadows of the rocks where
the sand is not hot enough to roast them, but there is no shade large
enough for larger animals. Each step sinks into the searing sand, the air
thick and hazy, each breath like drowning in lava.

    A shady grove offers a cool place to rest at this intersection. The
rolling grasslands to the south extend beyond sight, running parallel to
the forest of Silvanesti. The southern tip of the Khalkist mountains lies a
great distance towards the west, and rise up like towering giants. Beyond
that, though not visible, lies the waters of New Sea. Ogre Peaks and Onyx
Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name
suggests, is home to many ogres. The land to the north is a mighty plain
known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.
Skirting the northern tip of the Silvanesti forest, the road continues east

    With the lights out, the desert covered with numerous black spots of
desert growth. Here and there loom tall columns, and one rocky mass shaped
like a pipe organ. Eldritch wails sing songs of loss, driven by relentless
wind carrying sand that exfoliates the skin and stings the eye. Dry grasses
whip in the gale, drumming as they strike the ground, creating a cacophony
which is almost deafening.

the north, while massive waves of yellow-grey sands roll into hillocks and
shallow valleys to the south. The green vegetation denotes the edge of the
Plains of Dust as the air cools and clouds move in to block the harsh rays

[36mThe Ruins of Elial[0;37m
    The ruins of Elial rest here, endlessly battered and broken down by the
Plains of Dust. Elial was once the sister city of Purstal, but now both lie
crumbled and forgotten. A few small structures still remain intact, but
neglect will soon force them to collapse upon themselves. These ruins, much
like the others found in this wasteland, act as waypoints throughout the
region. Travelers might seek shelter in the ruins as they cross the plains,
which inadvertently attracts bandits and thieves. The ruins themselves can
be entered, but there is no indication of what lies hidden within.

    Heaps of timber and stone have formed large piles of rubble all
throughout the ruins of Elial. Crumbling stone structures offer a scant
shelter from the winds and none from the sun when it is highest in the sky.
Smaller buildings of rotten wood creak as the winds press on them and
threaten to topple them over. Despite the disarray, small tables and
campfires litter the roads as though somebody has established themselves
here. Several buildings remain to the north but much of the debris has
cordoned off several areas of the once bustling trade city.

[36mAmongst the Ruins of Elial[0;37m
    This cul-de-sac features three buildings that have fallen into
disrepair. Despite being unusable by most anyone's standards, it appears
someone has sought shelter inside. Faint flickers of light can be seen from
within, illuminating every cracked board and hole in their siding. Rubble
has been cleared from their entrances and piled up along their sides. There
is no way around the buildings and the street only leads back towards the
center.

[36mA Ramshackle Tavern[0;37m
    The rundown tavern has been abandoned for a long time, serving as just
another structure to provide a minimalistic shelter from the weather. The
remaining stores have long since been pilfered, and broken glass and bar
stools have cluttered the floors for ages. A random assortment of new
chairs and tables have been brought in, however, as the tavern seems to
have been reopened by its new occupants. Recently spilled ale covers the
wood floor, making it sticky to walk on. The scent of body odor lingers
heavy in the air as if many unwashed persons were just here.

[36mA Ramshackle Tavern[0;37m
    The rundown tavern has been abandoned for a long time, serving as just
another structure to provide a minimalistic shelter from the weather. The
remaining stores have long since been pilfered, and broken glass and bar
stools have cluttered the floors for ages. A random assortment of new
chairs and tables have been brought in, however, as the tavern seems to
have been reopened by its new occupants. Recently spilled ale covers the
wood floor, making it sticky to walk on. The scent of body odor lingers
heavy in the air as if many unwashed persons were just here.

[36mAmongst the Ruins of Elial[0;37m
    This cul-de-sac features three buildings that have fallen into
disrepair. Despite being unusable by most anyone's standards, it appears
someone has sought shelter inside. Faint flickers of light can be seen from
within, illuminating every cracked board and hole in their siding. Rubble
has been cleared from their entrances and piled up along their sides. There
is no way around the buildings and the street only leads back towards the
center.

[36mThe Center of the Ruins[0;37m
    Heaps of timber and stone have formed large piles of rubble all
throughout the ruins of Elial. Crumbling stone structures offer a scant
shelter from the winds and none from the sun when it is highest in the sky.
Smaller buildings of rotten wood creak as the winds press on them and
threaten to topple them over. Despite the disarray, small tables and
campfires litter the roads as though somebody has established themselves
here. Several buildings remain to the north but much of the debris has
cordoned off several areas of the once bustling trade city.

[36mBefore a Huge Mound of Rubble[0;37m
    This seems to be the unofficial junk pile of Elial. All debris and
rubble from the streets must have been gathered here to form what little
passage there is within the ruined city. The heap of rubble contains
everything from bent and rusted old metal spoons to crumbling walls, and
forms a semicircle around the area. Beyond the debris lies the remains of
the city, but it seems even more unusable than what is left to the north,
which seems to be the only interesting portion of town.

[36mBefore a Huge Mound of Rubble[0;37m
    This seems to be the unofficial junk pile of Elial. All debris and
rubble from the streets must have been gathered here to form what little
passage there is within the ruined city. The heap of rubble contains
everything from bent and rusted old metal spoons to crumbling walls, and
forms a semicircle around the area. Beyond the debris lies the remains of
the city, but it seems even more unusable than what is left to the north,
which seems to be the only interesting portion of town.

    Heaps of timber and stone have formed large piles of rubble all
throughout the ruins of Elial. Crumbling stone structures offer a scant
shelter from the winds and none from the sun when it is highest in the sky.
Smaller buildings of rotten wood creak as the winds press on them and
threaten to topple them over. Despite the disarray, small tables and
campfires litter the roads as though somebody has established themselves
here. Several buildings remain to the north but much of the debris has
cordoned off several areas of the once bustling trade city.

the walls have remained intact. A smaller room lies behind a door to the

Two long and curved horns protrude from the back of the skull of this young
red dragon. Although Smolder is inexperienced in combat, he makes up for it
in ferocity and vigor. A large dragonrider's saddle is attached to his
scaly back, and wraps around his yellow stomach. His massive red wings are
tucked back alongside his torso, but judging by his size his wingspan is
easily thirty feet. Faint puffs of steam are released through the young
dragon's nostrils as he exhales, a reminder of his innate fire-breathing
ability.

    Heaps of timber and stone have formed large piles of rubble all
throughout the ruins of Elial. Crumbling stone structures offer a scant
shelter from the winds and none from the sun when it is highest in the sky.
Smaller buildings of rotten wood creak as the winds press on them and
threaten to topple them over. Despite the disarray, small tables and
campfires litter the roads as though somebody has established themselves
here. Several buildings remain to the north but much of the debris has
cordoned off several areas of the once bustling trade city.

    The road here leads west, further into the ruins of Elial. Once
spanning to other great trade cities such as Purstal, Qindaras, and
Wallach, the road is now buried beneath the sands and snow of the Plains of
Dust. The ruined city groans softly in the breeze, as many of the
surrounding structures have already crumbled in the distant past. Still,
the ruins may well make for good shelter from the harsh environment
beyond. Booted footprints can be seen in the rubble leading through the
streets to the west as somebody seems to have already set up camp.

[36mThe Ruins of Elial[0;37m
    The ruins of Elial rest here, endlessly battered and broken down by the
Plains of Dust. Elial was once the sister city of Purstal, but now both lie
crumbled and forgotten. A few small structures still remain intact, but
neglect will soon force them to collapse upon themselves. These ruins, much
like the others found in this wasteland, act as waypoints throughout the
region. Travelers might seek shelter in the ruins as they cross the plains,
which inadvertently attracts bandits and thieves. The ruins themselves can
be entered, but there is no indication of what lies hidden within.

road west is completely useless now, having been destroyed during the
Cataclysm. It now stands like a behemoth in the barren wasteland that is
the Plains of Dust. It is now a relic that serves as a harsh reminder that
even the mightiest can fall. A rocky trail from the north leads down the
hill, following King's Road at its base. An unfragmented section of the
road remains intact, and can be accessed from this point leading east into
the forests of Silvanesti, however that road is free of wagon tracks and
hoof prints, no doubt believing the tales of horrifying nightmares that
have befallen the once great nation.

    The elevated highway that is King's road rises thirty feet beyond the
ground. Having been broken during the Cataclysm, the road is now a shell of
its former self. Aside from the roads state of disrepair, it sits too high
from the ground to be travelled on. Still, the ancient road serves as a
worthy guide through the harsh plains and towards the kingdom of
Silvanesti. To the west, the road has collapsed, leaving behind tall
pillars of stone that stretch out towards the sky and supporting nothing.

    King's Road was once a grand elevated highway which was supported
by large pillars thirty feet in the air running on pillars for 600 miles
from Thon-Thalas in the east to Purstal in the west. Originally molded from
stone by House Mason of the Silvanesti Elves as a means to travel from
Silvanesti, through the Plains of Dust and into Qualinesti, it was widely
used by merchants and travelers, however during the Cataclysm the highway
collapsed near Purstal and lies in ruins further west of that point.

    King's Road runs parallel to the Khaldat river, too high and too
ruined to be used as a means of transport. Broken columns reach towards the
sky, a reminder of what was and what will never be, while the saffron
colored sands blow in invisible winds. The faint sound of scurrying can be
detected if one ignores the bubbling burble of the broad river stretching
east and south into the Plains of Dust. The sound is probably from the
small animals that call the desolation their home.

    This once grand and beautifully crafted highway has been ravaged by the
harsh surrounding sands. It is said that King's Road once cut entirely
across what is now known as the Plains of Dust, leading all the way to
Sancrist. There is, however, little proof of King's Road extending beyond
this point, as anything that may lie further west is buried beneath the
sands. The road has collapsed, leaving heaps of rubble and debris on the
sands. King's road continues east, but is inaccessible from the ground.
Instead a much simpler road has been formed and runs alongside it's base.

Once a major trading city, and part of the Kharolis Empire, nothing of
Purstal remains but broken gates and crumbled buildings.

    Cool winds cut through your clothing, sending chills through your body
and adding insult to injury as they carry with them stinging grains of
reddish sand. This barren path cuts through the center of the Plains of

The town's namesake river has cut a huge ravine into the chiffon sands of
the wastelands, dropping forty to fifty feet below the ground level as the
arctic waters rush ever southwards in a futile charge towards the Icewall
Glacier. Hills and burrows of ice and silica have begun to form in the

[36mAmidst the Ruins of Twendle[0;37m
    A once flourishing trading post, Twendle sat nestled amongst the soft
hills of East Road. Merchants from the surrounding region would often stop
and gather necessary supplies from the centrally located village. But as
the Cataclysm struck and devastated the region, Twendle no longer could
afford to stay open. The destruction of East Road meant that no trade would
come from the east, and soon the villagers packed up their belongings and
left. Most travelled west towards Tarsis, or left Southern Ansalon entirely.
A few stuctures still remain in the village, though they are inhabited
mostly by bandits or vagabonds.

    Wind and blasts of sand dominate the openness of the gorge here. The
path is well beaten and stretches up the slope of the valley basin, giving
passage to a settlement in the distance. Smoke trails emanating from the
sparse grouping of huts hint at the possibility of a village to the
southeast. Various rock formations sit at the side of the road, corralling
travelers into a small trench leading up the valley.

    Although the Plains of Dust are generally barren and frigid, this scenic
road offers a pleasant view of the surrounding valley. The hard-packed road
winds through the gradually sloping hills, which helps protect you from the
sharp, crisp breeze flowing in from the south. Lone pine trees and shrubs
dot the hillsides and struggle for survival in this barren wasteland. The
trees remind you of the tenacity of the barbarians and nomads that inhabit
much of the inhospitable region. The road continues through the valley to
the west, and rises gently as it cuts through the hills to the north.

[36mBefore the Ruins of Purstal[0;37m
    The road to the east lies covered in huge chunks of broken grey stone
that have been pushed to the edges to clear a path. The stones once belonged
to King's road, which still runs hundreds of miles east towards the
Thon-Thalas River, deep within the lands of Silvanesti. To the west is an
arched stone bridge, spanning a fork in the Torath River. A series of
peculiar lights flash briefly to the north, where the ruins of Purstal lay.
Once a major trading city, and part of the Kharolis Empire, nothing of
Purstal remains but broken gates and crumbled buildings.

[36mThe Edge of King's Road[0;37m
    This once grand and beautifully crafted highway has been ravaged by the
harsh surrounding sands. It is said that King's Road once cut entirely
across what is now known as the Plains of Dust, leading all the way to
Sancrist. There is, however, little proof of King's Road extending beyond
this point, as anything that may lie further west is buried beneath the
sands. The road has collapsed, leaving heaps of rubble and debris on the
sands. King's road continues east, but is inaccessible from the ground.
Instead a much simpler road has been formed and runs alongside it's base.

ground. Having been broken during the Cataclysm, the road is now a shell of
its former self. Aside from the road's state of disrepair, it sits too high
from the ground to be travelled on. Still, the ancient road serves as a
worthy guide through the harsh plains and towards the kingdom of
Silvanesti. To the west, the road has collapsed, leaving behind tall
pillars of stone that stretch out towards the sky and supporting nothing.

    The River Shin comes to and end westwards here, breaking from the
northern path leading back to its source, the Torath River. The steep
rolling foothills are particularly inhospitable here: a few scraggly bits
of brush have braved the dry earth and pitiless winds, but besides that no
life is visible. Everywhere is rock and dust, the dismal landscape broken
only by the occasional jagged cliff face and the ever present canyon the
Shin has carved in its fruitless path towards the Icewall Glacier.

    The deep crevasse is known by the local inhabitants as the Scorpion
Wadi. The dried river bed curves like the tail of a scorpion and is also
home to many of the small black creatures. Small caves and canyons are
spread throughout the area, making it extremely easy to hide or defend from
enemies. Dark grasses with thick stalks grow along the edges of the
crevasse, creating a strange, shaggy shade which extends deep into the dry
earth.

[36mThe Mouth of a Canyon[0;37m
    The dry ground has turned from sand and silt to hard-packed clay and
rock. A wide trail slopes downward as it descends into a deep canyon. Caves
and overhangs have formed in the sandstone cliff faces, which were once the
shores of a since dried river. The canyon deepens and curves behind a wall
of rock, and the canyon walls only grow higher. Unable to see into the
caves that have been weathered into the rock, this canyon entrance makes
for the perfect place to be ambushed.

[36mA Curve in the Canyon[0;37m
    The canyon snakes along the dried earth to the north and west, but
beyond that is unclear. A ledge above is almost indistinguishable but seems
to follow the same curvature as the canyon bottom. It would be easy for
someone up above to stalk a hapless wanderer should they so wish, and it
would be nearly impossible for someone at the bottom to see them. The sound
of skittering rocks are amplified by the walls of the canyon as they slide
down the cliffs, and what caused them to fall is unknown.

[36mThe Bottom of a Dry Canyon[0;37m
    The bottom of the canyon here seems to be at its widest point, but
countless monochrome boulders disguise the surface of the cliff face. Some
large holes have been burrowed into the canyon walls, large enough for a
mountain lion to hide within. The dryness of the land makes a perfect
breeding ground for scorpions of which there are plenty. Most are too small
and inconsequential, but a cautionless step could warrant a poisonous
sting. What at first glance looked like a rock tumbling from the cliff
ledge was actually a much larger scorpion curled up as it fell. Not even
the insects are safe from the precariousness of the rocks here.

[36mAn Undercut Cave in the Canyon[0;37m
    Disguised by the monotonous geology of the canyon, this undercut in the
cave is tough to discern from outside. The canyon wall provides shelter
from the blaring sun which beats down mercilessly upon these rocks. The
shade here has significantly reduced the temperature which is much higher
to the west as the winds of the surrounding plains are unable to find their
way to the bottom of the canyon. Bits of trash and unnatural scraps signify
the presence of squatters, campers, or outlaws that call these canyons
home.

[36mThe Bottom of a Dry Canyon[0;37m
    The bottom of the canyon here seems to be at its widest point, but
countless monochrome boulders disguise the surface of the cliff face. Some
large holes have been burrowed into the canyon walls, large enough for a
mountain lion to hide within. The dryness of the land makes a perfect
breeding ground for scorpions of which there are plenty. Most are too small
and inconsequential, but a cautionless step could warrant a poisonous
sting. What at first glance looked like a rock tumbling from the cliff
ledge was actually a much larger scorpion curled up as it fell. Not even
the insects are safe from the precariousness of the rocks here.

    The canyon snakes along the dried earth to the north and west, but
beyond that is unclear. A ledge above is almost indistinguishable but seems
to follow the same curvature as the canyon bottom. It would be easy for
someone up above to stalk a hapless wanderer should they so wish, and it
would be nearly impossible for someone at the bottom to see them. The sound
of skittering rocks are amplified by the walls of the canyon as they slide
down the cliffs, and what caused them to fall is unknown.

has dried and settled here. The canyon walls are high above and are riddled
with openings and caves that may or may not lead further in. Rocks and

crumble, leaving ample hiding places for creatures of all sorts. The canyon
curves around with little reference as to how long it extends.

[36mThe Mouth of a Canyon[0;37m
    The dry ground has turned from sand and silt to hard-packed clay and
rock. A wide trail slopes downward as it descends into a deep canyon. Caves
and overhangs have formed in the sandstone cliff faces, which were once the
shores of a since dried river. The canyon deepens and curves behind a wall
of rock, and the canyon walls only grow higher. Unable to see into the
caves that have been weathered into the rock, this canyon entrance makes
for the perfect place to be ambushed.

[36mThe Scorpion Wadi[0;37m
    The deep crevasse is known by the local inhabitants as the Scorpion
Wadi. The dried river bed curves like the tail of a scorpion and is also
home to many of the small black creatures. Small caves and canyons are
spread throughout the area, making it extremely easy to hide or defend from
enemies. Dark grasses with thick stalks grow along the edges of the
crevasse, creating a strange, shaggy shade which extends deep into the dry
earth.

[36mThe Plains of Dust[0;37m
    The desolate conditions of the Plains of Dust are not at all improved
by the advent whipping winds and biting sands. Nevertheless, a few tough
and sinewed bushes have managed to take root among the crags and cliffs of
this inhospitable environment. The sand driven by the winds forms an
ever-changing tapestry of hill and vale, shifting from hour to hour at the
whim of the invisible gusts.

    Far to the south and forming a massive shelf of scintillating light
along the distant southern border of the Plains of Dust is the Icewall
Glacier. Freezing winds blow off the frigid wall, blasting across the
countryside unbounded by building or tree. A few small boulders seem to
have come to rest among the half-frozen vegetation. A trail through the

    The plain north-to-south flow of the river is only slightly interrupted
by a bizarre visual. In the middle of the river lie the shattered remnants
of a small stone building. The river bends slightly at the point,
indicating that, most likely, erosion of the canyon wall eventually became
severe enough to pull down a structure that had previously been atop it.
Years of flow have pushed the stones away from the eastern bank and into
the middle of the river. A crumbling chimney protrudes from the surface of
the water and is covered over with ice and lichens.

a light powdering of snow which settles on the ground briefly before
melting. The landscape is frozen in time and as unyielding as the compact
earth beneath your feet. Weathered shrubs have found a way to cling to
life, growing mere inches as the years drag on, but they only seem to
confirm the sparsity of the land. The chilling winds rise and fall with
immeasurable precision, yet they never seem to cease.

plants pull every available ounce of moisture from the petering course. The
deep canyon of the Gnome Gulch is visible to the north, but the ruins of
the Old Coast Road dominate this area. While this part of the road is only
used in winter, a careful examination reveals the footprints of icefolk in
the dust.

    The Twendle River has emerged from the Gnome Gulch, its weakening flow
now more akin to stream than river. A shallow rampart is all that separates
the dying waters from the Plains of Dust, and a surprising amount of plant
life has grown in the barren topsoil, despite the multitude of rocks,
boulders, and crags which scar the surface. A few stalwart pines have dared
to reach towards the unforgiving sky, while hearty brush and bushes grow
thick along the damp banks.

    There is no cold like the cold of the Twendle River. Housed in darkness
formed by massive cliffs which line either side of the rushing waters, the
river runs ragged towards the towering crystallized limestone of Icewall
Glacier. The winds, trapped by the faceless canyon walls, run faster than
the river, deafening the ears with their incessant roar. Yet perhaps the
greatest chill in this freezing environment is the chill from the soul of
one who sees such a bleak and lifeless world, formed by the arrogance of
man, destroying life and leaving only this frigid, dead shell.

    Even in the harsh environment of the Plains of Dust, along the steep
crevasse which cradles the Twendle River, life finds a way. Certainly the
winds blow hard and harsh, without respite, while the icy waters of the
river flee ever southwards towards Icewall Glacier, giving no pause and no
quarter. As yet, despite the inhospitable habitat a few stunted trees and
scrubby bushes have managed to lay roots and establish an existence in the
eternal shade of the gully.

    Tiny rivulets of water lap against the sand and coral which has amassed
at the base of the massive cliffs lying on either side of the river in this
part of the Plains of Dust. The river runs wide and calm here, a far cry
from the life-stealing rapids visible in either direction. The slowing of
the torrent has allowed life to teem in the shadowy light which battles
along the edge of the crevasse. A few fruit-bearing shrubs have cropped up
along one edge of the cliff face, while lizards and tiny skinks scramble

    This is the bottom of a deep, dark chasm. Forty feet above, the pale
rays of light which lambast the Plains of Dust can be seen, but none of
that light ever reaches this deep into the crevasse: the walls are too
steep, the crack is too narrow. A raging river rushes along the bottom of
this ravine, flowing with an intensity which is doomed to fade, making a
desperate escape from the New Sea to the craggy limestone of Icewall
Glacier. Like everything in the Plains, this river is fated to fail, but
its furious onslaught in the face of failure is still a sight to behold.

    The winds are calmer here within the Twendle River's crevasse than in
the rest of the Plain: the high cliff faces create a channel protected from
the winds most of the time. However, occasionally the gales align with the
chasm, and the power of the winds coupled with the speed of the rapids
makes this stretch of river truly harrowing. A few brave trees, stunted
from the lack of direct sunlight, have managed to cling perilously to the
stone edges of the rocky faces.

    Tall cliffs of craggy rock rise high above the surface of the river
that has cut its way across the surface of this stretch of the Plains of
Dust. A brisk chill hangs in the air, and its evidence is apparent in all
the perpetual ice that clings to small outcroppings along the sides of the
gully and the frost that decorates rocks that break the surface of the
river. The river itself is especially treacherous here, between the cold
muddy banks and near complete lack of handholds as it flows from east to
west.

[36mThe River Torath[0;37m
    The cliffs to the north are home to a small grove of trees that are
growing on a near vertical surface. An assortment of both evergreens and
broadleaf trees gives the impression of clinging precariously to tiny
outcroppings of rocks, while the reality is that their roots burrow deep
into the ground much as any other tree. A short rope has been tied to the
branch of one of them, and it dangles down perhaps a dozen feet. The
southern cliffs are also home to plant life, but theirs is simple scrub
brush accented by the occasional tall grass. The river flows in from the
east and continues to the west.
[33m[1mThe river flows strongly here, depositing ice and sediment along its steep banks.

[36mA Fork in the River[0;37m
    Torpid water struggles on its westward and southward journey at the
base of a steep canyon fork, which presumably cracks the surface of the
Plains of Dust high above. The southbound waters continue toward the
Icewall Glacier while the westbound waters will flow into the Blood Sands.
While perhaps only a trick of the odd angles of light deep in the canyon,
the river flowing west appears to shimmer with a faint red hue, perhaps
caused by clay and silt from the Blood Sands. Tall walls of rock tower to
the north, with boulders threatening to topple at any moment from more than
thirty feet above.

[36mRed Rose River[0;37m
    So named due to a red hue caused by mud and sediment from the Blood
Sands, the Red Rose River flows east to west. It cuts through rocky ground
forming cliffs that are about twenty feet high. Large boulders are visible
in the cliff sides, and apparently have, on occasion, fallen from the
cliffs to land in the water. A small length of white water has formed here
because of the toppled stones, and eddying pools are present on both the
north and south sides of the river above the rapids. To the west the cliffs
appear to lessen in height, and this gives the odd visual illusion of the
river flowing uphill.

[36mRed Rose River[0;37m
    The Red Rose River ends here in a small pool of churning water. Small
trickles of water can be seen moving off in every direction, but they
quickly disappear into the rocky ground, either due to evaporation into the
dry air, or due to flowing down into invisible subterranean passages. The
high cliffs that extend along the riverbanks to the east end gradually here
at the pool, dropping in height from about ten feet on the eastern edge of
the pool to only a foot or two along the majority of the western edge. The
dirt and mud along the banks is a deep ruddy red. The water in the pool at
the far side is only a couple of feet deep, an inglorious final destination
for the seemingly impossible flow of seawater away from the ocean and into
the Plains of Dust.

[36mBefore the Red Rose River[0;37m
    All that remains of the muddy red river is a trickle which quickly
dries up in the warmth of the plains. A very shallow pool of water has
formed just to the east, and though the murky waters are impenetrable by
light, it can't be very deep. The lands slope as they continue to the east,
forming small cliffs and ledges to the north and south. The thin riverbanks
on either side do not support much life as they are just as dry and
neglected as the rest of the Plains of Dust. The ground rises into sandy
hills to the west, which aside from the river is the only way to travel.

    These are the sands that time forgot. During the Age of Mortals, the
land has steadily gone from dry to even more desert-like. The summer months
seem to stretch out longer into spring and autumn, while the winter is
cruel and cold. The constant annual swings between unbearable heat and
insufferable chill have made even the most primitive of life avoid this
godforsaken tract of land. Nevertheless, tough, sinewy grasses and twiny
underbrush have managed to stake out an existence, despite the odds.

    There is almost no water to be found among the powdery sands, and no
trees whatsoever. A few cacti and tough low-lying bushes have managed to
stake out an existence, but little else. The ceaseless winds tear at the
sagebrush which has forced itself into the shallow soil, tearing at the
thin roots. Cruel winds wail as they fly violently over these godforsaken
plains.

    Dozens of sandy moguls stand like towering giants with each laborious
step as the heat from the desert saps your strength. Harsh winds sweep
across the Plains of Dust, causing a swirl of fine dust that suffocates
with each gust. Sparse shrubs and cacti have managed to sprout from the
cracks and crags in the earth as they thirstily compete for life-giving
water. Scorpions and rattlesnakes skitter across the desert, seeking
shelter in the pockets of shade provided by the vegetation.

prosperous town with emphasis on worshipping the god of wisdom, the

Small whirlwinds of white-grey silica spin in futility along the relative

ever-shifting dunes and dales they rarely get above ten feet high and do
nothing to break the apathetic stretch of horizon visible in all direction.

    The earth groans as the shallow ash-like sands of the Plains of Dust
blow through The Run, driven by a wind which knows no master, nor reprieve.
Small whirlwinds of white-grey silica spin in futility along the relative
flat of the land: while there is a faint rise and fall from the
ever-shifting dunes and dales they rarely get above ten feet high and do
nothing to break the apathetic stretch of horizon visible in all direction.

    Coral as sharp as a razor lies scattered between the puce soil and the
occasional gunmetal rock which has broken through the cinereous ground. A
thousand years ago this was the bottom of the ocean, and life teemed along
the sandy surface and in the salty waters above. Now, all of that is gone,
disappeared in a haze of human hubris. What is left is the pathetic shade
of grey and white stretching out into oblivion in all direction.

into small piles, revealing the hard remnants of oceanic life below, now
nothing more than the dirge of ages past. The Run has become little more
than a desert of ash, making life arduous and death unavoidable.

    In the stillness above the Plains of Dust, two hawks break the silence
with menacing caws. They quarrel with a viciousness brought on by immense
hunger. The otherwise lifeless sky stretches across the vast plains, as if

massive boulders are smaller rocks, which serve only to break up the
monotony of the dead lands. What little life that has found a way to
survive in the harsh environment is constantly vexed by the sun and

    Impassable rock formations stand to the south, impeding further passage
through the Plains of Dust. Harsh winds sweep across the Plains of Dust,
causing a swirl of fine dust that suffocates with each gust. The scruffy
plants which inhabit the plains have grown thick, drinking up the shrinking
waters. The ceaseless winds tear at the sagebrush which has forced itself
into the shallow soil, tearing at the thin roots.

[36mThe Plains of Dust[0;37m
    The constant annual swings between unbearable heat and insufferable
chill have made even the most primitive of life avoid this godforsaken
tract of land. Nevertheless, tough, sinewy grasses and twiny underbrush
have managed to stake out an existence, despite the odds. Here and there
deep gorges have been carved by the paths of the buffeting gales, creating
dangerous canyons which threaten to swallow the plains at any moment.

[36mThe Road to Tarsis[0;37m
    This, the road to Tarsis, strides boldly through the Plains of Dust,
plunging eastward through the plains and west towards the exotic city of
Tarsis. Glacial winds gust in from the south, hampering your journey. The
plains respond to these forceful winds, born in the heart of Icewall, with
incredible dust storms that constantly threaten to encroach upon Tarsis and
the roads leading to her. Very few plants have the will or tenacity to try
growing on these rocky soils, and the slightest green of a stubborn moss is
a sight for sore eyes.

the constant powdering of light snow which blows off the Icewall Glacier

[36mWithin a Small Cave[0;37m
    The cave has been carved into the side of the rocky outcrop and offers
excellent shelter from outside. Not only is the cave protected from the
harsh terrain, it is completely hidden from view. There are dozens of these
caverns scattered throughout the canyons and rock formations in the Plains
of Dust, but most go unnoticed. The cave is far enough from the road to
make it unlikely that it is used by bandits. Instead, the cave serves as
protection should the weather turn while traveling between Rigitt and
Tarsis.

Derek Crownguard looks at you carefully and says,

        'The Blue Dragonarmy is blocking the road to Tarsis. They are
    looking for some traveling companions, which means we can't get into
    the city right now. The Knights of Solamnia are not very welcome around
    these parts even still. The Tarsians still dislike the Knights of
    Solamnia, but I fear they do not wholly appreciate the looming danger
    of the Dragonarmies. We need to get into the city to visit the Library
    of Khrystan, if it still exists.'

Derek Crownguard turns to consult his fellow knights.

    The snow-powdered hills glisten in the unfiltered light of this
desolate wasteland, while indomitable and bushy plants grows along the
steep rocky outcrops. Forgotten hills and a few scraggly plants have dared
to break the incessant monotony of flat land and undulating plain. To the
east an overhang forms a cave in the hillside. Solitary flakes of snow
swirl across the wasteland, brought about by the bitter winds that blow
from Icereach to the south.

    The East Road curves along a ridge through the southern reaches of the
Plains of Dust. A shallow crevasse has formed in the earth to the north,
but prevents passage nonetheless. The road continues eastward where it can
be seen curving once again to the north. A short distance to the west it
slopes downwards and is covered by rocks large enough to prevent passage.
Far beyond that, the northern edge of Ice Mountain Bay can be seen. A small
fishing village is recognizable as the village of Rigitt, which lies
further south.

    The Plains of Dust stretch far to the east, but your view is obscured

northward a ways before curving to the east, but continues straight into
the village of Rigitt to the south. A brisk breeze wafts in from the west,
dampened by short boulders.

    The road runs directly south into the village of Rigitt, but continues
out of sight to the north. The Plains of Dust extend to the east,
encircling the village and extending beyond. Although the Plains of Dust
are famous for their red-hued sand, the ground is mostly frozen from the
cold and looks to be more gray than anything else. The biting winds can be
felt as they skip across the waters of Ice Mountain Bay to the west.

[36mAn Old Coast Road[0;37m
    To the south lies the village of Rigitt, its friendly atmosphere a
stark contrast to the bleakness of the Plains of Dust which lie to the
north. Harsh winds kick up pelting grains of sand which sting the skin. An
intense heat begins to beat down upon the road, causing a distorted and
wavering visage of the road that leads northward. Meanwhile, the town to
the south seems to offer refuge with its protective walls and proximity to
the water.

[36mThe Northern Entrance of Rigitt[0;37m
    The northern entrance to the town of Rigitt lies open and unguarded.
There is no gate to prevent outsiders from wandering freely into the city,
and there is little need. The town makes its living as a shipping and
trading town, but has no real wealth to speak of. The primary source of
trade comes from New Tarsis, but a rapidly expanded shipping industry will
one day dominate the cities source of revenue. A road leads south towards
the center of the city while to the west is a tall lighthouse that towers
of the waters of Ice Mountain Bay.

have been left to remain just west of here and act as a sort of barrier to
the marina to the southwest. The yellow cobblestones continue southward
towards the center of town.

[36mThe Northern Entrance of Rigitt[0;37m
    The northern entrance to the town of Rigitt lies open and unguarded.
There is no gate to prevent outsiders from wandering freely into the city,
and there is little need. The town makes its living as a shipping and
trading town, but has no real wealth to speak of. The primary source of
trade comes from New Tarsis, but a rapidly expanded shipping industry will
one day dominate the cities source of revenue. A road leads south towards
the center of the city while to the west is a tall lighthouse that towers
of the waters of Ice Mountain Bay.

[36mAn Old Coast Road[0;37m
    To the south lies the village of Rigitt, its friendly atmosphere a
stark contrast to the bleakness of the Plains of Dust which lie to the
north. Harsh winds kick up pelting grains of sand which sting the skin. An
intense heat begins to beat down upon the road, causing a distorted and
wavering visage of the road that leads northward. Meanwhile, the town to
the south seems to offer refuge with its protective walls and proximity to
the water.

    The road runs directly south into the village of Rigitt, but continues
out of sight to the north. The Plains of Dust extend to the east,
encircling the village and extending beyond. Although the Plains of Dust
are famous for their red-hued sand, the ground is mostly frozen from the
cold and looks to be more gray than anything else. The biting winds can be
felt as they skip across the waters of Ice Mountain Bay to the west.

    The trail leads west and east, cutting through snow-capped sandstone
cliffs which prevent passage to the north and south. The monochrome
landscape is broken up only by the sparse shrubs and small patches of snow,
carried in from the bitter winds blowing up from Icewall to the south.
Although the ground is covered in a coarse sand, it remains dormant and
crunches under your feet due to the low temperatures.

    Freezing winds blow in from the south, blasting across the

bleached by the constant powdering of light snow which blows off the
Icewall Glacier far to the south. Even in the dimmest illumination the

The occasional rocky crag offers some respite from the blizzarding gale

    The air bites at the skin with its frigid sting as the ever-present
winds blow in from the Icewall Glacier to the south. Despite the
inhospitable climate and terrain, the area sparkles with a majestic glow as
the sun is reflected from the snow and ice. Old Coast Road continues far to
the north, where the air is slightly warmer. A small settlement can be seen
to the east, coated in a powdering of snow.

    The high pitched scream of the gale forces are especially strong in the
deep gully which has been sliced into the dry earth. Almost no life dares
to breach the lifeless soil of these accursed plains, but a faint powder of
snow does intermingle with the resilient brush that has dared to challenge
the harsh environment. A few small boulders seem to have come to rest among
the half-frozen vegetation.

[36mThe Frigid Plains of Dust[0;37m
    The bitter cold winds blow across the Plains of Dust, cast from the
mighty Icewall that lies to the south. The wind howls as it carries with it
a light powdering of snow which settles on the ground briefly before
melting. The landscape is frozen in time and as unyielding as the compact
earth beneath your feet. Weathered shrubs have found a way to cling to
life, growing mere inches as the years drag on, but they only seem to
confirm the sparsity of the land. The chilling winds rise and fall with
immeasurable precision, yet they never seem to cease.

    A thin layer of snow lies atop the densely scattered rocks which
comprise the bedrock in the plains. The sand with which they are contained
lie motionless, as if huddled together for warmth as the icy wind assails

unforgiving than the Plains of Dust, yet even more majestic. The sunlight
glints and sparkles as it is reflected from the massive glaciers, making it
seem as though there are two suns.

    As the banks of the river narrow even further, the speed of the water
increases. Boulders litter this section of the river, but are fortunately
contained to the edges of the river, leaving a safe route through the
center of the river. The river continues to flow to the north, and a bank
to the south seems to offer egress from the river.

    You float along in the frigid waters of the Icia River, allowing the
current to carry you north. The water seems to pick up speed here as the
river narrows before entering the rapids to the north. Large rocks churn
the water to a froth there, and it may be dangerous to continue in that
direction. The bank to the east looks easy enough to climb , or you can
fight the current back south.

Most of the villagers hurry to their tents as you approach, unused to

    Inside, this dwelling is quite cozy.  Most of the cracks and holes have
been patched or filled with ordure to seal them.  In one corner, a stone
hearth lies stacked with wood, ready to be fed into the small firepit.
A soot blackened hole in the roof has been cunningly sheltered to allow the
smoke to escape while keeping the snow out.  A small pile of pelts is heaped
atop a large rug made from the skin of a snow leopard.  An altar, nearly
hidden behind a fur hung from the ceiling, is the only indication that this
is the abode of the village holy-man.

     The mighty river flows from the east to the north.  A small stream
joins the river from the south.  Within the river, large chunks of ice
bob up and down in the swift current.  The water is icy cold, obviously
snowmelt.

[36mIcia River[0;37m
    You float along in the frigid waters of the Icia River, allowing the
current to carry you north. The water seems to pick up speed here as the
river narrows before entering the rapids to the north. Large rocks churn
the water to a froth there, and it may be dangerous to continue in that
direction. The bank to the east looks easy enough to climb , or you can
fight the current back south.

snow extend east and south, and begin to diminish to the north. Even though
you are stangely dry after your trip down the river, the icy wind still
seems to chill you to the bone. You can re-enter the water to the west, or

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

number of merchants travelling between Newport and the towns of Solace and
Haven. Around you the landscape is dotted with trees and the area is hilly.
In the air you can faintly smell salt, carried by a breeze blowing from the
northeast. The road leads to the north and east from here. Southeast you can
hear the sounds of a bustling town and to the north you hear a low rumbling.

    The smell of salty air is carried by a warming breeze to the north and
east. To the southeast, the fishing community of Newport can be clearly
seen, surrounded on three sides by a bay of the New Sea. Fishing boats dot
the waters of the bay, as Newport citizens toil away in their trade. The
forested hills grow west of the bay, filling the view with tall oaks and
maples. Far to the south, the peace of the Kharolis Mountains rise in
majestic shadow.

    The Old Road is intersected here by the cobblestone road leading to the
small fishing community, Newport. Beyond Newport is a bay of the New Sea,
its waters stretching out across the horizon. The cobblestone continues to
the north, signifying the beginnings of a major trade route to the towns of
Solace and Haven further to the north. The majestic forests of the fabled
elven capitol of Qualinost deepen to the southwest. If you travel south you
can also come upon Pax Tharkas. If you travel north, you will hit the River
White Rage.

[36mA Busy Loading Dock[0;37m
    The wooden planks of the dock are covered in stacks of crates, waiting
to be taken by trading ships to other parts of Ansalon. The clear blue
waters of the outer bay become slightly muddied as the water comes closer to
shore. There is a pier running north of here, with several large ships
anchored to mooring lines. To the west, Rapid's Drive runs its curving
course along the outlines of the shore.

[36mThe Southern Pier[0;37m
    The southern pier of Newport runs along the shore, the waters of the
bay stretching out beyond sight. The wooden planks of the pier bob slightly
with the brush of the tide. There are several ships tied to the mooring
ropes, with various trading symbols painted on their hulls. A pile of boxes
and crates sit here, waiting to be loaded into some ships. A few of the
locals are sitting along the pier, casting their lines into the waters for
the shallow dwelling fish. A large dock extends to the north, where merchants
bustle about looking for new merchandise.

[36mThe Southern Pier[0;37m
    The southern pier of Newport runs along the shore, the waters of the
bay stretching out beyond sight. The wooden planks of the pier bob slightly
with the brush of the tide. There are several ships tied to the mooring
ropes, with various trading symbols painted on their hulls. A pile of boxes
and crates sit here, waiting to be loaded into some ships. A few of the
locals are sitting along the pier, casting their lines into the waters for
the shallow dwelling fish. A large dock extends to the north, where merchants
bustle about looking for new merchandise.

[36mA Strange Dwelling[0;37m
    The small dwelling contains all of the basic necessities one would
expect to have in a town such as Newport. What is unusual however, is the
strange crystal embedded into the table in the centre of the room. Multi-
coloured flames blaze in the air just above the crystal, lighting up the
room with their prismatic flickerings.

    The Old Road is intersected here by the cobblestone road leading to the
small fishing community, Newport. Beyond Newport is a bay of the New Sea,
its waters stretching out across the horizon. The cobblestone continues to
the north, signifying the beginnings of a major trade route to the towns of
Solace and Haven further to the north. The majestic forests of the fabled
elven capitol of Qualinost deepen to the southwest. If you travel south you
can also come upon Pax Tharkas. If you travel north, you will hit the River
White Rage.

    The well maintained Old Road continues its path to the north and south.
The forests to the west are made up of thousands of tall oaks, their
branches spreading outwards in a glorious canopy. This forest is the
boundary of the Qualinesti elves, their capitol Qualinost somewhere in the
northern parts. The road south leads eventually to the Kharolis Mountains
and on south to Tarsis.

    The path on which you stand emerges from the surrounding forest
suprisingly quickly into a barren landscape marred by a recent attack by
the axes of loggers. The surrounding hills that rise up around you are
scarred with rotting stumps, and here and there sage brush occasionally
mars the landscape. Whether your eyes deceive you or not, the way westward
appears to lead downhill into a small valley.

[36mEmerging From the Forest[0;37m
    The path on which you stand emerges from the surrounding forest
suprisingly quickly into a barren landscape marred by a recent attack by
the axes of loggers. The surrounding hills that rise up around you are
scarred with rotting stumps, and here and there sage brush occasionally
mars the landscape. Whether your eyes deceive you or not, the way westward
appears to lead downhill into a small valley.

    The forest grows thicker around the roadside, the branches over head
blocking out the sun. You hear the sounds of animals all around you. Since
its fairly dark here, you hear the sounds of night animals out looking for a
good meal. Looking east, the forest is not as thick and the path is lighter.
To the west the forest continues to encroach on the path making the daytime
vanish even more from your sight. You hesitate to go that way.

rule such as Pax Tharkas and the ruins of Xak Tsaroth. Of course, the fabled
Inn of the Last Home in Solace and the streets of Haven are welcome spots
for the tired traveller. To the south, cold weather prevails as the chilly

    Here the road leads across a large bog, crossing it at one of the more
narrow points. The bog is rather wide to the east, but not quite as wide to
the west. The road has been built up with stones, wood and dirt to maintain
a stable platform for travellers. Its not a work of art but it does the
job. Foothills are visible to the north and the vast plains of Dergoth are
spread out to the northeast. The bog can be seen in all directions from
here, but lucky for you the road leads north and south through it.

    The pass here is very rocky and rough. The going is not easy. On both
sides of you the Kharolis mountains loom over you and threaten to close and
remove this pass from Krynn. Rocks are strewn about, they appear to have
fallen off of the mountains on both sides of you.

[36mA Mountain Road[0;37m
    To the north is a sheer drop off the side of the mountain. High winds
threaten to blow you off the side of the mountain and you quickly realize
that, even flying, your chances of surviving a step off the cliff would be
minimal. To the south, a small path between the keep and some boulders back
towards the main gate of the keep. Off to the west, a small ledge winds its
way between the keep walls and a sheer drop-off. It might be safe to go
that way, but you wonder if you should risk it. To the east, the winding
road leads down the mountain.

to Thorbardin. However, a terrible earthquake has caused the passageway

rubble. Although the passage into the kingdom is destroyed, the indomitable

[36mAt the Foot of a Mountain[0;37m
    The ground here at the foot of the mountain is unnaturally smooth,
almost as if the rock was hewn flat to ease the passage of trade carts. Of
course, there are no cart marks and few bootprints, so perhaps it's just
nature playing tricks on the mind. The unusually flat ground continues and
expands to the west, while a narrow gap between the giant boulders off to
the south allows relatively easy movement in that direction.

    The ground here at the foot of the huge mountain is unnaturally smooth,
almost as if the granite was hewn flat to create a plaza where trade carts
could gather at the foot of the biggest mountain in the region. Of course,
there are no cart marks and few bootprints, even if the smooth area seems
unnaturally wide and the cliff formed by the mountain meeting the ground is
perfectly vertical. The unusually flat ground narrows a bit as it continues
to the east and west from here, flanked by an impervious wall of boulders.

is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the

[36mSouth Hall of Justice[0;37m
    This great hall is where the royal officers make major decisions about
justice that govern the whole kingdom of Thorbardin. As the dwarven society
is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the
god Reorx, this hall also functions as the dwarves' most holy temple. Giant
marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. The massive
hall continues south and west and the sign hanging on the locked gate to
the giant lift in the eastern wall says it is for official use only.

[36mA Busy Intersection of Roads[0;37m
    Three of Thorbardin's massive Roads come together to meet at this busy
intersection. The ground is paved with striated granite cobblestones which
have been arranged in angular patterns that form a fourteen-pointed star.
The sign in the center of the intersection says the Ninth Road leads off to
the west, the Fourteenth Road lies north of here, and the Fifteenth Road
extends to the east. At the southern end of the busy intersection stands a
massive marble hall guarded by a pair of gigantic bronze doors.

    This great hall is where the royal officers make major decisions about
justice that govern the whole kingdom of Thorbardin. As the dwarven society
is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the
god Reorx, this hall also functions as the dwarves' most holy temple. Giant
marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. A pair of
massive bronze doors guard the entrance to the north, while rubies set into
the ground lead towards the arched bridge to the holy altar to the south.

    An enormous anvil of red granite stands on a platform suspended over a
bottomless pit by four arching stone bridges holding it up. The runes of
divinity carved around the base of the anvil clearly indicate that it is an
altar to Reorx. The altar gleams proudly under the light of huge glittering
diamonds embedded in the domed black ceiling to resemble stars, arranged
like the constellations of Paladine and Takhisis circling each other. The
bridges lead off in each of the cardinal directions, but since the southern
part of the hall has caved in, the end of that bridge has been blocked.

    The giant rock looming over the path is as tall as a vallenwood, and it
must be the biggest boulder on the entire continent. Although its surface
has been methodically eroded by weather, mere nature has done nothing to
diminish its massive size. A narrow path leads off to the east, while the
foot of an impossibly tall mountain lies a few steps to the north.

    Before you stand two huge brass gates which once guarded the entrance
to Thorbardin. However, a terrible earthquake has caused the passageway
beyond the gates to collapse, sealing off the entrance forever. The giant
gates have fallen off their hinges and lean forlornly against the piles of
rubble. Although the passage into the kingdom is destroyed, the indomitable
mountain known as Cloudseeker still stands, reaching towards the sky. To
the north and south, narrow paths lead around the cliffs surrounding the
mountain, and a sloping path to the east leads back down the mountain.

[36mA Trail Skirting the Bog[0;37m
    A small trail skirts the northern edge of the bog. A low mist hangs
over the stunted tamarak and black spruce trees that try to thrive on the
patches of elevated peat mats. The trail leads to an elevated roadway to
the west and winds along the edge of the bog to the east, where the peak of
a small cabin can be seen.

    A raised road leads across the bog to the south and to the west. The
road has been built up with various materials to accommodate the travellers
of this region. The bog can be seen in all directions from here, the only
thing to save you from it is the road. To the distant north you see some
foothills slowly growing smaller and fading into the flat plains of
Dergoth. The eastern arm of the Kharolis mountains can be seen far off to
the west.

    A large bog lies to the south east and west directions. The road here
has been built up to maintain a dry and stable platform for the many
travellers passing through these parts. In some spots the bog has reclaimed
the land that once belonged to it. Foothills can be seen to the west and
north directions. To the north the foothills slowly give way to the plains
of Dergoth. The raised road through the bog leads to the north and east
from here.

[36mThe Breaks Foothills[0;37m
    These foothills skirt the eastern edge of the Kharolis Mountains and
provide an excellent place to hunt game. The forests are mainly spruce and
pine, reflecting the cold seasonal climate. There is a large bog to the
south of here and to the northeast, the hills flatten out to the plains of
Dergoth. You can see the snowy peaks on the highest spires of the Kharolis
Mountains to the distant west.

    A cool breeze flows in from the south and the road you are on is well
maintained. A soft lush forest embraces this road and the landscape seems to
change at this point. To the north, the lands of Abanasinia stretch out with
rumors of Qualinesti and Darkenwood and places where the Dragon Highlords
rule such as Pax Tharkas and the ruins of Xak Tsaroth. Of course, the fabled
Inn of the Last Home in Solace and the streets of Haven are welcome spots
for the tired traveller. To the south, cold weather prevails as the chilly
winds from the Kharolis and Icereach make these lands inhospitable.

north a small clearing can be seen, with a cabin in it. The endless forest
stretches to the west and south, where the elusive Qualinesti elves are
rumored to reside. Looking straight up, you see a huge nest perched high in
the tree.

    Thick clumps of vibrant green ferns and shrubs grow on either side of
this small path, obscuring vision of almost everything beyond their thick
foliage. Small weeds and saplings have begun to spring through the packed
dirt of the path, suggesting that it has not seen much use in the recent
years. Countless ancient trees dominate the area and their leaves create a
thick canopy high above, parting just enough in small areas to reveal the
sky beyond. The small path continues to weave through the thick wilderness
in both the northern and southern directions.

[36mA Heavily Overgrown Trail[0;37m
    Twisted networks brown roots and hardy brush plants have grown over the
surface of this thin trail, making it difficult to keep track of as it
passes through the forest. The area is alive with the sounds of life which
range from choirs of birds chirping in harmony to the soft rustling of
fallen leaves as nearby creatures forage for food. Gentle winds breeze
between the trees carrying the soft scent of moist plants, a result of
recent rainfall being absorbed by thirsty flora. The faint trail grows
noticeably more pronounced as it winds north, yet it seems to vanish
entirely into the wild forests that grow even thicker to the west.

[36mThe Wild Qualinesti Forest[0;37m
    All signs of civilization have entirely disappeared, utterly consumed
by the wild growth of this untamed forest. The deep green colours of
foliage growing on the ancient trees is beautifully contrasted by the
splendrous reds, purples and yellows of the blooming flowers which are
scattered throughout the surroundings. Fallen leaves and dead twigs cover
the forest floor, slowly decaying to provide nutrients to the other nearby
flora. Beautiful birds flutter through the branches above while insects
scurry along the ground, creating an environment which is in a constant
state of change. The wild forest continues in both the western and southern
directions while a faint, overgrown trail is visible nearby to the east.

[36mSouthern Avenue[0;37m
    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
