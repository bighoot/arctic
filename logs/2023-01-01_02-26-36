Black Dragonarmy recruits a place to enjoy their meals. Simple wooden
planks held up by crudely carved wooden legs act as makeshift benches,

importance. Tantalizing aromas of roasting meat drift in from the south,
indicating the barracks kitchen lies in that direction. The long hallway

care has been taken in hewing the stones used to make the massive walls,
clearly showing where the city's priorities lie. A dreary gloom hangs over
