    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

As you are tumble down the waterfall, you scream in terror at the sight of rocks below.
[36mAn Underground Pool[0;37m
    A beautiful pool of deep black water is the result of the tall
waterfall, which extends up into the darkness of the mountain. The walls
and rocky ground are covered in a vibrant form of blue moss, which lights
the area with its humble glow. In the pool, jagged rocks stick out from
under the water, which twinkles in the blue light. To your east is an
overhanging rock ledge that seems to offer the best opportunity to step out
of the pool. Scaling the wall along the waterfall is impossible.

    Over a slight ledge at the western end of this subterranean path lies a
magnificent pool, glowing a soft blue. Crashing sounds are impressively
audible from the waterfall, which drops into the pool. It does not appear
safe to climb down the ledge and into the pool, because of the large,
sharply pointed rocks, abrasively jutting out of the water. The only way
out of the room appears to be further along this eastward underground path.

    Some large rocks in the middle of the set path, force caution with each
step. On the sides of the path large stalagmites rise sharp points into the
air, directing a very winding motion to the trail. Astoundingly, small dark
vegetation grows out of the rocky ground even with the lack of sunlight.
The air is very quiet here, as if this route has not been used for many
years. Only the slight splash of water to the west prevents utter silence.
The journey through the mountain caves continues both to the east and
south.

    Winding through the stalagmite fields of the deep mountain caves,
caution is necessary with each step, due to the rocky uneven path. The
largest stalagmites prevent wandering off in desired directions. An almost
indistinguishable sound of water pitter-pattering on rocks develops from
the northwest. All other sounds seem to be muted. The caves continue to the

    Through the stalagmite fields to the east, a clear exit from the
winding trail is visible at a strange underground intersection. While the
trail presently traveled is devoid of life, other than the small dark
leaved vegetation, the presence of a potentially humanoid-made junction
alleviates the claustrophobia caused by thirty thousand tons of rocks above
you. To the west lies a winding trip through the stalagmites, while to the

[36mA Rough Tunnel Adjoining a Crystal Grotto[0;37m
    Thousands of crystal shards litter the floor of the cave here,
cluttered with as many small and large rocks. The colorful edges of the
crystalline walls are quite sharp and jagged, warping light in a circular
rainbow pattern. A dark tunnel leads off into the north, and to the south a
gigantic crystal grotto reflects thousands of colors and patterns from the
light.
