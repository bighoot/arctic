Welcome to the land of Krynn.

[35mThe Inn of Myth[0;37m
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the

source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    A dark aura clouds the hallway east of here, where the black doors of a
temple radiate wickedness. The stone wall opens up in an archway to the
south, which leads into a sloppy mess hall, and to the west the hallway
twists off heading south. Light breezes whisper in through slat-like

this, what would be ground level in this subterranean building, by a flight
of stairs against the southern wall. Though you can't see into it very well
from here, you can feel the breeze of freshly circulated air from the room
above, a welcome change from the stagnant and stale air of these
underground halls. To the north the hallway you are in, meets up with
another hallway running east-west.

it, while the southern hallway stops at a flight of stairs that lead up to

tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though
the safest path is anyone's guess.

[36mBefore a Gate[0;37m
    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    The tunnel here is not naturally lit, but a dim blue light emanating

is not enough to see in the darkness. The coarse walls meet in a corner to
the southwest, and draw the tunnel on to the north and east.

    The tunnel takes an abrupt turn here, leading into darkness both south
and west. A melodic trickling sound echoes through the cavernous walls, its
source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the
tunnel continues into darkness.

[36mA Musty Cell[0;37m
    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    The punishment of simply having to live in this cell seems almost as

the room in tightly, already adding to the claustrophobic sense of having
no windows and only one way out. In the northwest corner of the room a vile
bucket of waste has been knocked over, saturating the room with an
overpowering stench. A simple cot is pressed to the southern wall, and all
around mold and grime spread freely across the walls.

kept dark down here to further depress the prisoners. The groans and foul
curses of the rowdy prisoners fill your ears. It seems only a lucky few

[36mDungeon Corridor[0;37m
    The corridor stretches north and south. Heavily barred cells run along
the opposite walls. Every odd interval you come across a torch stuck in the
stone, only to find it long ago burnt out. You wonder if it is purposefully
kept dark down here to further depress the prisoners. The groans and foul
curses of the rowdy prisoners fill your ears. It seems only a lucky few
will ever see the light of day again.

    Flames flicker from torches set in the opposite walls casting eerie
shadows along the length of the corridor. They give little warmth and
barely any light for you to see your way. The air is cold and stale down
here, the mood oppressive as barred dungeon cells stretch down the hall.
The groans and mutterings of prisoners fill your ears. To the east and west
lie two doors.

    The corridor stretches north and south. Heavily barred cells run along
the opposite walls. Every odd interval you come across a torch stuck in the
stone, only to find it long ago burnt out. You wonder if it is purposefully
kept dark down here to further depress the prisoners. The groans and foul
curses of the rowdy prisoners fill your ears. It seems only a lucky few
will ever see the light of day again.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of

partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is

[36mThe Intersection[0;37m
    You are at a huge intersection in the forest. Southern Avenue meets
with Park Road and Forest Lane here. There is a small opening in the trees
above that allows a view of the sky above. A small breeze blows through
here and you inhale deeply. Southern Avenue leads north and south from the
intersection, while Forest Lane leads off west and Park Road exits to the
east.

[36mBefore Some Ruined Brass Gates[0;37m
    Before you stand two huge brass gates which once guarded the entrance
to Thorbardin. However, a terrible earthquake has caused the passageway
beyond the gates to collapse, sealing off the entrance forever. The giant
gates have fallen off their hinges and lean forlornly against the piles of
rubble. Although the passage into the kingdom is destroyed, the indomitable
mountain known as Cloudseeker still stands, reaching towards the sky. To
the north and south, narrow paths lead around the cliffs surrounding the
mountain, and a sloping path to the east leads back down the mountain.

[36mA Tight Passage[0;37m
    The passage way between the mountain walls and the piles of boulders
is just wide enough for a fair-size adventuring party to pass through. The
boulders look unsteady and you would hate to have to climb up on them, but
thankfully don't look like there will be an avalanche. To the north, the
path opens up and you can see a set of ruined gates, while to the south,
the tight passageway continues through the barren mountain range.

and you guess that you would end up sliding off the mountain if you tried
it. To the north, the tight passage continues, while southward, the passage

    There is a fair-size clearing here, but as you look north and west, you
see the passageways are much tighter. To the north, there is a passage
between the walls of the mountain and a bunch of boulders and rubble piled
high. Westward, a small path winds its way into the depths of the Kharolis
Mountains, passing between a mountainside and jagged cliffs. To the south,
a steep, but usable path leads down to the road near Tarsis.

must be the biggest boulder on the entire continent. Although its surface
has been methodically eroded by weather, mere nature has done nothing to
diminish its massive size. A narrow path leads off to the east, while the

course, there are no cart marks and few bootprints, so perhaps it's just
nature playing tricks on the mind. The unusually flat ground continues and
expands to the west, while a narrow gap between the giant boulders off to
the south allows relatively easy movement in that direction.

break through the giant stone plug known as Southgate. Any invading forces

to suddenly turn right, which makes fighting very awkward for right-handed
fighters, to ascend the huge spiral ramp that leads into Thorbardin.

    This steep spiral ramp revolves three quarters of a turn in a clockwise
direction as it ascends nearly fifty feet from bottom to top. The surface
of the ramp is unpaved, but smooth except for the parallel tracks designed
to accommodate merchant carts. A few murder holes are hidden in the wall to
aid in repelling would-be attackers foolish to attempt an invasion.

of pink granite that merge seamlessly into a giant, arching stone bridge
that spans the yawning chasm to the north. The south end of the road slopes
down and turns abruptly to wind down a huge spiral ramp. There is also a
small side street to the east which leads to a residential area.

is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the
god Reorx, this hall also functions as the dwarves' most holy temple. Giant
marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. The area to
the west of here has caved in, and the dwarves haven't repaired it yet. The
hall continues north, while bronze doors guard the entrance to the east.

[36mSouth Hall of Justice[0;37m
    This great hall is where the royal officers make major decisions about
justice that govern the whole kingdom of Thorbardin. As the dwarven society
is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the
god Reorx, this hall also functions as the dwarves' most holy temple. Giant
marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. A pair of
massive bronze doors guard the entrance to the north, while rubies set into
the ground lead towards the arched bridge to the holy altar to the south.

    Three of Thorbardin's massive Roads come together to meet at this busy
intersection. The ground is paved with striated granite cobblestones which
have been arranged in angular patterns that form a fourteen-pointed star.
The sign in the center of the intersection says the Ninth Road leads off to
the west, the Fourteenth Road lies north of here, and the Fifteenth Road
extends to the east. At the southern end of the busy intersection stands a
massive marble hall guarded by a pair of gigantic bronze doors.

    The black nickel gate to the east seems to have been intentionally

damaged enough to be easily knocked down. And yet, the mark of the theiwar

not to be taken for granted. In fact, it's probably best to stay away. The
shouting to the south sounds like it comes from a busy wharf, while a ramp
leading down echoes with the clanging sounds of a cart station below.

[36mOutside Theibardin[0;37m
    The black nickel gate to the east seems to have been intentionally
warped, as if to make any potential invaders looking at it wonder if it's
damaged enough to be easily knocked down. And yet, the mark of the theiwar
above the gate suggests that it is infused with powerful magic, and thus
not to be taken for granted. In fact, it's probably best to stay away. The
shouting to the south sounds like it comes from a busy wharf, while a ramp
leading down echoes with the clanging sounds of a cart station below.

    Impatient dwarves hustle to and fro along this busy wharf, eager to get
on with haggling over the price of everything from copper ore to minced
mushroom. A large winch system sits upon the rocky shore, and thick cables
stretch off across the Urkhan Sea to guide mechanized ferries over the
water. The sign posted here indicates that the ferries will take passengers
to the magnificent Life Tree at the center of the enormous Urkhan Sea.

[36mA Cart Station on the Sixth Road[0;37m
    Smoke and soot belch out of the enormous machine that dominates this
cavern. The machine is a marvel of dwarven engineering, and it drives a
cart and track system for efficiently moving people and goods throughout
the kingdom of Thorbardin. According to a sign carved on the wall, this
station provides transit to the west, following the Sixth Road.

    This wharf is crammed into a narrow tunnel and is not very busy. The
most exciting thing here is the incredible variety of mushrooms filling the
crates stacked neatly against the southern wall. A large winch system sits 
upon the rocky shore, and thick cables stretch off across the Urkhan Sea to
guide mechanized ferries over the water. The sign here says that ferries

[36mThe Western Docks[0;37m
    Built on the limestone island beneath the Life Tree at the center of
Thorbardin, these docks bustle with activity as dwarves from every clan
pass through on the way to the taverns, forges, and shops housed within. A
large winch system sits upon the rocky shore, and thick cables stretch off
across the Urkhan Sea to guide the mechanized ferries over the water. The

will deposit passengers near the mushroom farms of the Western Warrens.

from here, widening gradually as it rises towards the shadowy ceiling far
above the Urkhan Sea. The outer surface of the stalactite is covered with
an unusual, iridescent coral which casts a warm light that illuminates the
vast cavern surrounding it. Here at its base, the magnificent stalactite
tapers until it is only as wide around as a dwarven waist where it merges
with the limestone island beneath it. A trio of vertical transport shafts
cut through the center of the Life Tree, and the screeching pulleys of the
steam-powered lifts drown out the sounds coming from the nearby docks.

[36mLevel 10 Lift Station[0;37m
    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a dwarf steps off on
this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must
have fallen off contraptions being transported to other parts of the huge
mountain kingdom. Unlike gnomish parts, these spare parts are as finely
made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

the huge vallenwood trees that cover the Solace Vale. Stretching out to the
north, these fields are known as Nearfields to the citizens of Solace
because of their proximity to the small town. A thick forest of pine trees
lies to the west, beyond which the Crystalmir Lake can be seen. To the east
this dirt trail merges with a wide road.

[36mA Narrow Road[0;37m
    A narrow road leads deep into a thick forest of very tall trees and
north it leads through the plains of Abanasinia. Around you are many trees
but not as many as to the south. The road runs in the near shadows of the
Kharolis mountains which can be seen off to the west, beyond a great lake.
The mountains appear to run north for some distance before ending. The
plains spread out to the north from here for many leagues.

[36mA Narrow Road[0;37m
    This narrow, dirt road winds its way through the great forest, curving
around large trees and rocks. You can hear the chattering of hundreds of
animals all around you, and a few of the trees seem to have large claw
marks. To the south, lies the northern gate of Solace, and to the north,
the road continues. Large bushes block your view to the east and west.

[36mThe Northern Gate of Solace[0;37m
    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.
