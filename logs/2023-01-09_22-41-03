correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some

[35mThe Halls of Myth[0;37m
    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

    Winding its way through the windy and fertile Plains, the highway
stretches to the east and to the west, escaping the horizon. Quiet and
depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the highway, their
heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains surround the
highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and weeds.
The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire. To the
south, a large mountain range rises through the sky. Most of the mountains
appear jagged and snow-capped.

    The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal
place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,
scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

[36mThe West Bank[0;37m
    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,

[36mBefore the Eastern Gates of Vingaard[0;37m
    Vingaard's immense iron gates stand directly to the west, where they
present a significant obstacle to any attacking force, but currently they
have been raised high to allow passage of people and horses. High stone
walls run north and south from here, extending quite a ways before turning
beyond your vision. A stone highway leads east through the Solamnic plains
and a cobblestone avenue heads west through the gates.

    A large road runs along the edge of the Vingaard River, just east of
the City of Vingaard. The road stretches south to the gates of Vingaard
City, and north where it turns east toward a ferry landing. A bit of smoke
drifts over the top of the walls, its pale color visible in the sky. The
running river gurgles gently as it flows northward to the sea.

    A wide road runs from the east gate of Vingaard northward, and then
turns east to a ferry landing. A building stands just to the north of the
landing, a sweet smell coming from its cooking fire. A much smaller road
leads north toward some farmland. The massive city walls rise to the west,
shielding the town from any possible invaders.

    A small building has been built here, just north of the road. The
building is apparently there as a living area for the ferry's operators. A
small section of the building's roof extends out over the road to serve as
a place of waiting for the ferry. A small dock juts out into the flowing
waters of the Vingaard, a series of cleats along its edges to tie up the
ferry.

    The clear waters of the Vingaard River gently flow northward, toward
Kalaman and the Northern Courrain Ocean. The river is fairly wide though
seems a bit narrower in this area, likely the reason a ferry was set up
here. Light shimmers off the water, dancing about the irregularities in the
water's usually smooth surface. A few fish can barely be seen swimming
about.

appears to be too fast and wide for you to cross safely by yourself. As you
survey the river banks around you, you notice a ferry not far from you.
Perhaps you can get a ride across the river on it. Leading away from the
river there is a path heading north.

the estuary of the river to the northeast. The river is thinner here, banks
herding the river on its course. On each of the north and south sides of
the rivers, roads lead through the lands towards Palanthas and the Lord
City of Kalaman.

    Three rows of five slender coral beds dominate the interior space of
this medical ward, carved into living coral. At each bedside is a small
white coral cabinet with a cross of red coral, probably containing medical
supplies. The medical ward is certainly in use, as a few tall Dargonesti
warriors seems to be on the mend from a recent battle. The center of the
medical ward lies to the north.

    Three rows of five slender coral beds dominate the interior space of
this medical ward, carved into living coral. At each bedside is a small
white coral cabinet with a cross of red coral, probably containing medical
supplies. The medical ward is certainly in use, as a few tall Dargonesti
warriors seems to be on the mend from a recent battle. The center of the
medical ward lies to the south.

    This small corridor connects the medical ward to the Temple of Abbuku.
It is constructed of living white coral, with fish moving in and out of
holes in the walls at will. The water in the area breathes as fresh and
clean as air, which is a bit peculiar, but quite welcome.

    Bright blue coral pews growing directly out of the living white coral
floor have been lined up in rows facing the north end of the temple. Small
fish duck through holes and between large strands of seaweed at the sides
of the temple. To the east a small corridor can be seen through the coral,
and to the north an altar is easily seen. A calming serenity hangs in the
air here, renewing the spirits of the good and the devout.

    Bright blue coral pews growing directly out of the living white coral
floor have been lined up in rows facing the north end of the temple. Small
fish duck through holes and between large strands of seaweed at the sides
of the temple. To the east a small corridor can be seen through the coral,
and to the north an altar is easily seen. A calming serenity hangs in the
air here, renewing the spirits of the good and the devout.

    To the north stands a splendid temple constructed from living white
coral. The white coral walls are flecked with specks of blue, marking it
as the Temple of Abbuku. South of here, Water Way leads away from the
serenity of temple. Tall strands of green and red kelp grow out of the
ocean floor, the currents causing them to arch gracefully overhead.

dargonesti who inhabit this underwater city. Growing next to the path are
a variety of kelps and sea plants in an array of greens, reds, and pinks.
To the west the path ends at the 'Y' of Water Way, while the path to the
north leads to an enormous building of living white coral.

[36mThe 'Y' of Water Way[0;37m
    The distinctive street of Darthalla, Water Way is a street shaped in
the form of a dolphin's tail. Water Way Central is the tail proper, while
Water Way East and West are shaped to resemble fins. The 'Y' here is the
where the elements meet, so it is quite a busy intersection. Families of
Darthallans often travel westward to the gardens where that they can swim
amongst the miniature coral reefs, slowly cultivated by expert Darthallan
gardeners. The eastern fin leads to the Temple of Abbuku, where injured
Darthallan warriors are cared for, and the next generation of devotees is
trained. Finally, to the south lies Water Way Central, which leads to the
more lucrative areas of town. The soft brown silt of the path would feel
gooey between the toes. The water is fresh and clear.

    The western tail fin of Water Way leads right to the entrance of the
renowned coral gardens of Darthalla. Expert dargonesti gardeners have
spent centuries studying nature and its processes to learn to cultivate
the miniature coral reefs and rare sea plants growing within the verdant
gardens. To the east lies the 'Y' of Water Way. The path to the gardens
is lined with brown, yellow, and green kelp.

    Skinny strands of kelp rise from the soft silt of the floor here. The
kelp creates a beautiful mix of greens, browns, and yellows. A beautiful
lavender archway to the south signals where Water Way ends and the coral
gardens begin. There are a few trampled reefs in this area, but the truly
magnificent specimens are found throughout the gardens beyond. Dargonesti
families and young couples from the city both seem to enjoy coming to the
gardens to pass time, as many groups of sea elves wander by.

    Apparently, the gardeners have difficulty maintaining aquatic life
in this corner of the park. The little reefs that have been able to grow
here are a dull orange color, and it appears they are the remains of what
was once a single large reef. The southwest corner of this area backs up
against a tall stone cliff, while travel to the north is impeded by an
undulating forest of dark green kelp. To the east, a miniature reef of
neon pink is readily visible, and it certainly looks more inviting than
this somewhat more ominous location.

kelp creates a beautiful mix of greens, browns, and yellows. A beautiful
lavender archway to the south signals where Water Way ends and the coral
gardens begin. There are a few trampled reefs in this area, but the truly
magnificent specimens are found throughout the gardens beyond. Dargonesti
families and young couples from the city both seem to enjoy coming to the
gardens to pass time, as many groups of sea elves wander by.

    The magenta coral has been fashioned in an intricate manner, creating
what can only be described as a jungle gym for young dargonesti children.
The aquatic life in this area has been limited to coral and a few strands
of kelp, as fish would rather not be bothered by the children crawling
over the web of bright corals. In the southwestern corner of the area, a
small sign stands near the tall stone cliff. The children clearly do not
approach this area. A tall coral fence to the south blocks access to the
private gardens of the Speaker of the Moon.

[36mThe 'Y' of Water Way[0;37m
    The distinctive street of Darthalla, Water Way is a street shaped in
the form of a dolphin's tail. Water Way Central is the tail proper, while
Water Way East and West are shaped to resemble fins. The 'Y' here is the
where the elements meet, so it is quite a busy intersection. Families of
Darthallans often travel westward to the gardens where that they can swim
amongst the miniature coral reefs, slowly cultivated by expert Darthallan
gardeners. The eastern fin leads to the Temple of Abbuku, where injured
Darthallan warriors are cared for, and the next generation of devotees is
trained. Finally, to the south lies Water Way Central, which leads to the
more lucrative areas of town. The soft brown silt of the path would feel
gooey between the toes. The water is fresh and clear.

[36mThe Origin of the Tail[0;37m
    This is the intersection of Darthallan streets where the famous Water
Way, shaped like a dolphin's tail, begins. The tail travels northwards to
where it eventually branches. To the east lies the opulent Andurias Way,
named for the ancient hero who led the first group of nomads who founded
the city. Most of the Darthallan nobility live in this direction. To the
west, Moon Way leads directly to Darthalla's Tower of the Moon. The soft
brown silt is gooey here, and the water is refreshingly clean.

[36mThe 'Y' of Water Way[0;37m
    The distinctive street of Darthalla, Water Way is a street shaped in
the form of a dolphin's tail. Water Way Central is the tail proper, while
Water Way East and West are shaped to resemble fins. The 'Y' here is the
where the elements meet, so it is quite a busy intersection. Families of
Darthallans often travel westward to the gardens where that they can swim
amongst the miniature coral reefs, slowly cultivated by expert Darthallan
gardeners. The eastern fin leads to the Temple of Abbuku, where injured
Darthallan warriors are cared for, and the next generation of devotees is
trained. Finally, to the south lies Water Way Central, which leads to the
more lucrative areas of town. The soft brown silt of the path would feel
gooey between the toes. The water is fresh and clear.

[36mThe 'Y' of Water Way[0;37m
    The distinctive street of Darthalla, Water Way is a street shaped in
the form of a dolphin's tail. Water Way Central is the tail proper, while
Water Way East and West are shaped to resemble fins. The 'Y' here is the
where the elements meet, so it is quite a busy intersection. Families of
Darthallans often travel westward to the gardens where that they can swim
amongst the miniature coral reefs, slowly cultivated by expert Darthallan
gardeners. The eastern fin leads to the Temple of Abbuku, where injured
Darthallan warriors are cared for, and the next generation of devotees is
trained. Finally, to the south lies Water Way Central, which leads to the
more lucrative areas of town. The soft brown silt of the path would feel
gooey between the toes. The water is fresh and clear.

    This is the intersection of Darthallan streets where the famous Water
Way, shaped like a dolphin's tail, begins. The tail travels northwards to
where it eventually branches. To the east lies the opulent Andurias Way,
named for the ancient hero who led the first group of nomads who founded
the city. Most of the Darthallan nobility live in this direction. To the
west, Moon Way leads directly to Darthalla's Tower of the Moon. The soft
brown silt is gooey here, and the water is refreshingly clean.

of the Darthallan nobility live in the glittering coral palaces that line
the tiled street. To the east, a particularly large coral palace stands
behind a delicate, silvery gate. A massive stone cliff blocks movement to
the north, so the wide street turns to the south where a few less opulent
palaces march off into the distance.

[36mThe Origin of the Tail[0;37m
    This is the intersection of Darthallan streets where the famous Water
Way, shaped like a dolphin's tail, begins. The tail travels northwards to
where it eventually branches. To the east lies the opulent Andurias Way,
named for the ancient hero who led the first group of nomads who founded
the city. Most of the Darthallan nobility live in this direction. To the
west, Moon Way leads directly to Darthalla's Tower of the Moon. The soft
brown silt is gooey here, and the water is refreshingly clean.

    The beautiful jade gates of the Tower of the Moon rise at the western
end of Moon Way. The soft silt of Moon Way has taken on a strange silvery
color, but remains quite gooey in texture. Matching silver coral arbors
make for a magnificent journey to the gates. To the east lies Darthalla
proper and some of the most prosperous homes of the city. Gardeners must
keep the kelp very trim in this section of Darthalla, as there is no kelp
to be seen.

[36mThe Entrance to the Tower of the Moon[0;37m
    The doorway to the Tower of the Moon lies directly to the south. The
tower itself has been constructed of a magical mix of corals. Some of the
corals are alive adding a glittering silver flourescence to the tower. The
living corals, though, seem to be growing from a base of extremely sturdy
petrified coral. The doorway is quite massive. It has been constructed from
mithril and had individual embossed gold panels. The panels are decorated
with a brilliant silver moon and a cerulean dolphin curled so that its nose
is almost touching its tail. To the east the jade gates of the palace glow
a brilliant green, while to the west there is a small garden for the
tower's inhabitants.

[36mA Large Coral Antechamber[0;37m
    The entrance to the Tower of the Moon is an enormous antechamber made
from glittering silver coral that emits a soft, soothing light. The floor
is made of pale pink marble that must be regularly polished by the Tower
servants. To the east, a hole in the coral serves as a guard's house. The
tiny room is empty except for a small sponge bunk, and a marvelous piece
of glowing green coral. The corridor curves to both the west and south,
while the mithril doors in the northern wall allow an easy exit from the
Tower. Glittering coral corridors lead to the west and south from here,
and enormous bubbles seem grow from the walls in both directions.

    Lit by the glittering silver coral that form the walls of the Tower of
the Moon, this corridor circles the first level of the Tower. Set into the
eastern wall is a tremendous bubble that serves as a window into the ocean
surrounding the city of Darthalla. While the ocean is dark, it also seems
to pose no threat from this position within the Tower. In the western wall
is an alcove, filled with a statue of a pair of twin dargonesti scouts who
once led the Darthallans. The corridor's pink marble floor continues to
the northwest and southwest.

of what once must have been a giant sea snail the size of fifteen elves. The
shell spirals up into the heart of the Tower of the Moon. An alcove on the

of the most beautiful dargonesti ever to rule the sea elves. On the southern
wall, a mosaic displays part of the history of the Darthallans. This mosaic
reflects off the well-polished pink marble floor. Other stories depicted on

    The Chambers of the Council is the sacred meeting place of the Council
of the Seas. This council has weighed on important issues facing the races
of sea people through the ages. Dominating the center of the chambers is a
beautiful table, constructed from petrified ironwood. Around the table are
some sponge chairs, which frequently go unused as Council members prefer
floating in the water. The chambers can be exited through doors made of
petrified wood to both the south and east.

[36mThe Chambers of the Council[0;37m
    The Chambers of the Council is the sacred meeting place of the Council
of the Seas. This council has weighed on important issues facing the races
of sea people through the ages. Dominating the center of the chambers is a
beautiful table, constructed from petrified ironwood. Around the table are
some sponge chairs, which frequently go unused as Council members prefer
floating in the water. The chambers can be exited through doors made of
petrified wood to both the south and east.

    Atop the yellow-spotted shell of what was once a gigantic snail, the
second floor of the Tower of the Moon takes shape. To the north, double
doors made of petrified redwood, perhaps salvaged from a sunken ship, mark
the entrance to the Chambers of the Council. A glittering coral corridor
is visible to the east, where it bends northwards. The floor is made of a
light blue marble, punctuated by an opening that leads down the shell to
the bottom floor of the Tower.

    The entrance to the Tower of the Moon is an enormous antechamber made
from glittering silver coral that emits a soft, soothing light. The floor
is made of pale pink marble that must be regularly polished by the Tower

tiny room is empty except for a small sponge bunk, and a marvelous piece
of glowing green coral. The corridor curves to both the west and south,
while the mithril doors in the northern wall allow an easy exit from the
Tower. Glittering coral corridors lead to the west and south from here,
and enormous bubbles seem grow from the walls in both directions.

[36mThe Entrance to the Tower of the Moon[0;37m
    The doorway to the Tower of the Moon lies directly to the south. The
tower itself has been constructed of a magical mix of corals. Some of the
corals are alive adding a glittering silver flourescence to the tower. The
living corals, though, seem to be growing from a base of extremely sturdy
petrified coral. The doorway is quite massive. It has been constructed from
mithril and had individual embossed gold panels. The panels are decorated
with a brilliant silver moon and a cerulean dolphin curled so that its nose
is almost touching its tail. To the east the jade gates of the palace glow
a brilliant green, while to the west there is a small garden for the
tower's inhabitants.

    Beautiful tiles of polished coral line this wide street, named after
the ancient hero who led the first group of nomads here, Andurias. Many
of the Darthallan nobility live in the glittering coral palaces that line
the tiled street. To the east, a particularly large coral palace stands
behind a delicate, silvery gate. A massive stone cliff blocks movement to
the north, so the wide street turns to the south where a few less opulent
palaces march off into the distance.

of glowing green coral. The corridor curves to both the west and south,

[36mA Glittering Coral Corridor[0;37m
    Lit by the glittering silver coral that form the walls of the Tower of
the Moon, this corridor circles the first level of the Tower. Set into the
eastern wall is a tremendous bubble that serves as a window into the ocean
surrounding the city of Darthalla. While the ocean is dark, it also seems
to pose no threat from this position within the Tower. In the western wall
is an alcove, filled with a statue of a pair of twin dargonesti scouts who
once led the Darthallans. The corridor's pink marble floor continues to
the northwest and southwest.

    Atop the yellow-spotted shell of what was once a gigantic snail, the
second floor of the Tower of the Moon takes shape. To the north, double
doors made of petrified redwood, perhaps salvaged from a sunken ship, mark
the entrance to the Chambers of the Council. A glittering coral corridor
is visible to the east, where it bends northwards. The floor is made of a
light blue marble, punctuated by an opening that leads down the shell to
the bottom floor of the Tower.

tiny room is empty except for a small sponge bunk, and a marvelous piece
of glowing green coral. The corridor curves to both the west and south,

corals are alive adding a glittering silver flourescence to the tower. The
living corals, though, seem to be growing from a base of extremely sturdy
petrified coral. The doorway is quite massive. It has been constructed from
mithril and had individual embossed gold panels. The panels are decorated
with a brilliant silver moon and a cerulean dolphin curled so that its nose
is almost touching its tail. To the east the jade gates of the palace glow
a brilliant green, while to the west there is a small garden for the
tower's inhabitants.

named for the ancient hero who led the first group of nomads who founded
the city. Most of the Darthallan nobility live in this direction. To the

[36mAndurias Way[0;37m
    Beautiful tiles of polished coral line this wide street, named after
the ancient hero who led the first group of nomads here, Andurias. Many
of the Darthallan nobility live in the glittering coral palaces that line
the tiled street. To the east, a particularly large coral palace stands
behind a delicate, silvery gate. A massive stone cliff blocks movement to
the north, so the wide street turns to the south where a few less opulent
palaces march off into the distance.

[36mThe Origin of the Tail[0;37m
    This is the intersection of Darthallan streets where the famous Water
Way, shaped like a dolphin's tail, begins. The tail travels northwards to
where it eventually branches. To the east lies the opulent Andurias Way,
named for the ancient hero who led the first group of nomads who founded
the city. Most of the Darthallan nobility live in this direction. To the
west, Moon Way leads directly to Darthalla's Tower of the Moon. The soft
brown silt is gooey here, and the water is refreshingly clean.

coralsmith, but far in the distance, the classic Darthallan coral huts can
be seen to both the east and the west. To the north lies the 'Y' of Water
Way, which splits into Water Way East and Water Way West. Southwards, the
path continues until it meets another intersection.

[36mThe 'Y' of Water Way[0;37m
    The distinctive street of Darthalla, Water Way is a street shaped in
the form of a dolphin's tail. Water Way Central is the tail proper, while
Water Way East and West are shaped to resemble fins. The 'Y' here is the
where the elements meet, so it is quite a busy intersection. Families of
Darthallans often travel westward to the gardens where that they can swim
amongst the miniature coral reefs, slowly cultivated by expert Darthallan
gardeners. The eastern fin leads to the Temple of Abbuku, where injured
Darthallan warriors are cared for, and the next generation of devotees is
trained. Finally, to the south lies Water Way Central, which leads to the
more lucrative areas of town. The soft brown silt of the path would feel
gooey between the toes. The water is fresh and clear.

[36mThe 'Y' of Water Way[0;37m
    The distinctive street of Darthalla, Water Way is a street shaped in
the form of a dolphin's tail. Water Way Central is the tail proper, while
Water Way East and West are shaped to resemble fins. The 'Y' here is the
where the elements meet, so it is quite a busy intersection. Families of
Darthallans often travel westward to the gardens where that they can swim
amongst the miniature coral reefs, slowly cultivated by expert Darthallan
gardeners. The eastern fin leads to the Temple of Abbuku, where injured
Darthallan warriors are cared for, and the next generation of devotees is
trained. Finally, to the south lies Water Way Central, which leads to the
more lucrative areas of town. The soft brown silt of the path would feel
gooey between the toes. The water is fresh and clear.

short swim off the path. The primary shops belong to a hide worker and a
coralsmith, but far in the distance, the classic Darthallan coral huts can
be seen to both the east and the west. To the north lies the 'Y' of Water
Way, which splits into Water Way East and Water Way West. Southwards, the
path continues until it meets another intersection.

    This is the intersection of Darthallan streets where the famous Water
Way, shaped like a dolphin's tail, begins. The tail travels northwards to
where it eventually branches. To the east lies the opulent Andurias Way,
named for the ancient hero who led the first group of nomads who founded
the city. Most of the Darthallan nobility live in this direction. To the
west, Moon Way leads directly to Darthalla's Tower of the Moon. The soft
brown silt is gooey here, and the water is refreshingly clean.

color, but remains quite gooey in texture. Matching silver coral arbors
make for a magnificent journey to the gates. To the east lies Darthalla
proper and some of the most prosperous homes of the city. Gardeners must
keep the kelp very trim in this section of Darthalla, as there is no kelp
to be seen.

    The doorway to the Tower of the Moon lies directly to the south. The
tower itself has been constructed of a magical mix of corals. Some of the
corals are alive adding a glittering silver flourescence to the tower. The
living corals, though, seem to be growing from a base of extremely sturdy
petrified coral. The doorway is quite massive. It has been constructed from
mithril and had individual embossed gold panels. The panels are decorated
with a brilliant silver moon and a cerulean dolphin curled so that its nose
is almost touching its tail. To the east the jade gates of the palace glow
a brilliant green, while to the west there is a small garden for the
tower's inhabitants.

[36mA Large Coral Antechamber[0;37m
    The entrance to the Tower of the Moon is an enormous antechamber made
from glittering silver coral that emits a soft, soothing light. The floor
is made of pale pink marble that must be regularly polished by the Tower
servants. To the east, a hole in the coral serves as a guard's house. The
tiny room is empty except for a small sponge bunk, and a marvelous piece
of glowing green coral. The corridor curves to both the west and south,
while the mithril doors in the northern wall allow an easy exit from the
Tower. Glittering coral corridors lead to the west and south from here,
and enormous bubbles seem grow from the walls in both directions.

    Lit by the glittering silver coral that form the walls of the Tower of
the Moon, this corridor circles the first level of the Tower. Set into the
eastern wall is a tremendous bubble that serves as a window into the ocean
surrounding the city of Darthalla. While the ocean is dark, it also seems
to pose no threat from this position within the Tower. In the western wall
is an alcove, filled with a statue of a pair of twin dargonesti scouts who
once led the Darthallans. The corridor's pink marble floor continues to
the northwest and southwest.

[36mA Curve in the Glittering Coral Corridor[0;37m
    The glittering coral corridor bends around a circular meeting room that
lies to the northwest. In the center of the curved southeastern wall stands
a bust of the current Speaker of the Moon. The corridor leads north to a
dead end, or west into the rest of the tower. The light from the glittering
coral walls reflects beautifully off the light blue marble floor.

[36mAbove a Gigantic Snail Shell[0;37m
    Atop the yellow-spotted shell of what was once a gigantic snail, the
second floor of the Tower of the Moon takes shape. To the north, double
doors made of petrified redwood, perhaps salvaged from a sunken ship, mark
the entrance to the Chambers of the Council. A glittering coral corridor
is visible to the east, where it bends northwards. The floor is made of a
light blue marble, punctuated by an opening that leads down the shell to
the bottom floor of the Tower.

shell spirals up into the heart of the Tower of the Moon. An alcove on the
northern wall of the corridor houses the statue of what must have been one
of the most beautiful dargonesti ever to rule the sea elves. On the southern
wall, a mosaic displays part of the history of the Darthallans. This mosaic

    The entrance to the Tower of the Moon is an enormous antechamber made
from glittering silver coral that emits a soft, soothing light. The floor
is made of pale pink marble that must be regularly polished by the Tower
servants. To the east, a hole in the coral serves as a guard's house. The
tiny room is empty except for a small sponge bunk, and a marvelous piece
of glowing green coral. The corridor curves to both the west and south,
while the mithril doors in the northern wall allow an easy exit from the
Tower. Glittering coral corridors lead to the west and south from here,
and enormous bubbles seem grow from the walls in both directions.

tower itself has been constructed of a magical mix of corals. Some of the
corals are alive adding a glittering silver flourescence to the tower. The
living corals, though, seem to be growing from a base of extremely sturdy
petrified coral. The doorway is quite massive. It has been constructed from
mithril and had individual embossed gold panels. The panels are decorated
with a brilliant silver moon and a cerulean dolphin curled so that its nose
is almost touching its tail. To the east the jade gates of the palace glow
a brilliant green, while to the west there is a small garden for the
tower's inhabitants.

make for a magnificent journey to the gates. To the east lies Darthalla
proper and some of the most prosperous homes of the city. Gardeners must

    This is the intersection of Darthallan streets where the famous Water
Way, shaped like a dolphin's tail, begins. The tail travels northwards to
where it eventually branches. To the east lies the opulent Andurias Way,
named for the ancient hero who led the first group of nomads who founded
the city. Most of the Darthallan nobility live in this direction. To the
west, Moon Way leads directly to Darthalla's Tower of the Moon. The soft

    The doorway to the Tower of the Moon lies directly to the south. The
tower itself has been constructed of a magical mix of corals. Some of the
corals are alive adding a glittering silver flourescence to the tower. The
living corals, though, seem to be growing from a base of extremely sturdy
petrified coral. The doorway is quite massive. It has been constructed from
mithril and had individual embossed gold panels. The panels are decorated
with a brilliant silver moon and a cerulean dolphin curled so that its nose
is almost touching its tail. To the east the jade gates of the palace glow
a brilliant green, while to the west there is a small garden for the
tower's inhabitants.

    The private coral garden of the Speaker of the Moon is a carefully
cultivated space filled with extremely small beds of coral reef colonies.
The colors are quite vibrant: magenta, turquoise, lime, and neon pink. Tiny
fish swim in and out of the miniature reefs. There are beautiful benches
from which the Darthallan nobility can overlook the extremely small
colonies. A bubbled window sticks into the garden from the south. To the
east lies the entrance to the Tower of the Moon. Through a fence to the
north the Coral Gardens are evident.

from glittering silver coral that emits a soft, soothing light. The floor
is made of pale pink marble that must be regularly polished by the Tower
servants. To the east, a hole in the coral serves as a guard's house. The
tiny room is empty except for a small sponge bunk, and a marvelous piece
of glowing green coral. The corridor curves to both the west and south,
while the mithril doors in the northern wall allow an easy exit from the
Tower. Glittering coral corridors lead to the west and south from here,
and enormous bubbles seem grow from the walls in both directions.

to pose no threat from this position within the Tower. In the western wall
is an alcove, filled with a statue of a pair of twin dargonesti scouts who
once led the Darthallans. The corridor's pink marble floor continues to

    Lit by the glittering silver coral that form the walls of the Tower of
the Moon, this corridor circles the first level of the Tower. Set into the
eastern wall is a tremendous bubble that serves as a window into the ocean
surrounding the city of Darthalla. While the ocean is dark, it also seems
to pose no threat from this position within the Tower. In the western wall
is an alcove, filled with a statue of a pair of twin dargonesti scouts who
once led the Darthallans. The corridor's pink marble floor continues to
the northwest and southwest.

living corals, though, seem to be growing from a base of extremely sturdy
petrified coral. The doorway is quite massive. It has been constructed from
mithril and had individual embossed gold panels. The panels are decorated
with a brilliant silver moon and a cerulean dolphin curled so that its nose
is almost touching its tail. To the east the jade gates of the palace glow
a brilliant green, while to the west there is a small garden for the
tower's inhabitants.

[36mA Glittering Coral Corridor[0;37m
    Lit by the glittering silver coral that form the walls of the Tower of
the Moon, this corridor circles the first level of the Tower. Set into the
eastern wall is a tremendous bubble that serves as a window into the ocean
surrounding the city of Darthalla. While the ocean is dark, it also seems
to pose no threat from this position within the Tower. In the western wall
is an alcove, filled with a statue of a pair of twin dargonesti scouts who
once led the Darthallans. The corridor's pink marble floor continues to
the northwest and southwest.

    The polish of the pink marble floor here is dutifully maintained by the
servants of the Tower of the moon. The polish is particularly noteworthy in
this section of the corridor as the beautiful mosaic on the southern wall
reflects its image of the floor. To the east is a remarkable bubble window
that opens a view into the depths of the ocean. The corridor, lit by the
glittering coral walls and ceiling, leads northeast and southwest.

[36mAt a Magnificent Spiral Staircase[0;37m
    The corridor arrives at this tremendous staircase made from the shell
of what once must have been a giant sea snail the size of fifteen elves. The
shell spirals up into the heart of the Tower of the Moon. An alcove on the
northern wall of the corridor houses the statue of what must have been one
of the most beautiful dargonesti ever to rule the sea elves. On the southern
wall, a mosaic displays part of the history of the Darthallans. This mosaic
reflects off the well-polished pink marble floor. Other stories depicted on
the massive mosaic are visible far to the east and west.

of sea people through the ages. Dominating the center of the chambers is a

some sponge chairs, which frequently go unused as Council members prefer
floating in the water. The chambers can be exited through doors made of

tiny room is empty except for a small sponge bunk, and a marvelous piece
of glowing green coral. The corridor curves to both the west and south,

tower itself has been constructed of a magical mix of corals. Some of the
corals are alive adding a glittering silver flourescence to the tower. The
living corals, though, seem to be growing from a base of extremely sturdy
petrified coral. The doorway is quite massive. It has been constructed from
mithril and had individual embossed gold panels. The panels are decorated
with a brilliant silver moon and a cerulean dolphin curled so that its nose
is almost touching its tail. To the east the jade gates of the palace glow
a brilliant green, while to the west there is a small garden for the
tower's inhabitants.

    The distinctive street of Darthalla, Water Way is a street shaped in
the form of a dolphin's tail. Water Way Central is the tail proper, while
Water Way East and West are shaped to resemble fins. The 'Y' here is the
where the elements meet, so it is quite a busy intersection. Families of
Darthallans often travel westward to the gardens where that they can swim
amongst the miniature coral reefs, slowly cultivated by expert Darthallan
gardeners. The eastern fin leads to the Temple of Abbuku, where injured
Darthallan warriors are cared for, and the next generation of devotees is
trained. Finally, to the south lies Water Way Central, which leads to the
more lucrative areas of town. The soft brown silt of the path would feel
gooey between the toes. The water is fresh and clear.

[36mWater Way West[0;37m
    The western tail fin of Water Way leads right to the entrance of the
renowned coral gardens of Darthalla. Expert dargonesti gardeners have
spent centuries studying nature and its processes to learn to cultivate
the miniature coral reefs and rare sea plants growing within the verdant
gardens. To the east lies the 'Y' of Water Way. The path to the gardens
is lined with brown, yellow, and green kelp.

gardens begin. There are a few trampled reefs in this area, but the truly
magnificent specimens are found throughout the gardens beyond. Dargonesti

gardeners to resemble a pod of leaping dolphins. A remarkable breed of
clownfish with white-striped pink bodies swim through the crevices and

grooming them as they go in an exquisite example of mutualism. There is a
white coral bench for lovers to sit and watch the pink reef. This area is
noted among Darthallans for its ability to spark burgeoning romances.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. To the south a huge
fireplace can be seen. Small tables fill the room, and at each sits at
least one or two people, the majority of which are in deep conversation. At
one of the tables, a young elf is busy playing a beautiful tune on a small
golden harp.
