as a room registry. Belle sits behind a pine counter, quietly reading,
until a customer arrives. Behind her is a long rack of wooden cubbyholes
and hooks holding room keys. Long halls with many closed doors stretch to
either side. It's quiet and well-kept here, conducive to a good night's

    Elegantly carved columns of white lie on either side of the arched
entryway. A massive chamber filled with endless rows of bookshelves lies to
the east beyond the archway. Reflective tiles of marble shine with a luster
rarely found. Though the chamber has been recently cleaned, cobwebs still
dangle from the ceiling trim and other hard to reach places. A winding
staircase can be seen to the west, while a sprawling library opens up to
the east.

    This simple but elegant hallway is a brief reprieve from the nearby
maze of bookshelves. The hall here is well lit by round glowing orbs which
rest atop silver wall sconces and shine light to every corner and crevice.
It's difficult to discern the material of the sheer white walls to the

flawless. There is a large doorway set in the southern wall, an even larger
set of doors to the west lead to the library, and the hallway continues

[36mAn Intersection of Bookshelves[0;37m
    Rows of bookshelves lead in every direction, with upper and lower
shelves stacked in each row. Since the intersection is a reprieve from
bookshelves it has been used as a storage space for old reading tables and
other library equipment. The Aesthetics have put considerable work into
dusting this space and keeping the pathways clear of debris.

[36mA Dusty Pile of Rubble[0;37m
    A stark contrast to the nearby rows, the bookshelves here have been
reduced to a large pile of rubble blocking passage in some directions. The
shelves that are still visible are broken and covered in dust, with many
books lost to the ages. Far above the bookshelf remnants there are wide
skylights that are dark and barely visible, offering no additional light.
The Aesthetics speak of this section with deep sadness, lamenting the
knowledge lost. It is difficult to move without stepping on rocks and
debris and to continue on the path north or east would be impossible.

wall sconces that illuminate the room completely. At the centre of the

organized mahogany desk and a large mahogany bookcase displaying books and
the symbols of Gilean. A doorway in the centre of the west wall leads

    This simple but elegant hallway reaches a corner here, with a pathway
continuing to the north and west. The hall here is well lit by round
glowing orbs which rest atop silver wall sconces and shine light to every
corner and crevice. It's difficult to discern the material of the sheer
white walls to the south and east, but unlike the rest of this aging

the south, and a much larger heavy wood door in the wall to the east with a
small but inviting rug at the foot of the door.

continuing to the north and west. The hall here is well lit by round
glowing orbs which rest atop silver wall sconces and shine light to every
corner and crevice. It's difficult to discern the material of the sheer
white walls to the south and east, but unlike the rest of this aging
library they appear flawless. There is a small doorway in the hallway to
the south, and a much larger heavy wood door in the wall to the east with a
small but inviting rug at the foot of the door.

[36mA Quiet Office[0;37m
    This office appears to belong to someone addicted to their work. In the
centre of the room sits a large oak table burdened with piles of books and
papers. There is a well-used cot in the corner of the room, flanked by a
stack of books and a small oil lamp for reading. The room is not decorated
at all but the walls are draped with lists and charts, and the room is
gently lit by a few lamps. The only exit is the doorway leading back into
the hall.

bookshelves in this row, two lower and two upper. The shelves appear to go

    It would take a keen eye to find a speck of dust among these
bookshelves after the hard work of the Aesthetics. There are four
bookshelves in this row, two lower and two upper. The shelves appear to go
on forever, housing hundreds of books. Far above the highest shelves the
ceiling appears to have wide skylights which have been covered with earth
and rock. There is an eerie silence about this place, and each footstep
echoes almost eternally.

    Dwarven craftsmen took pride in the work it took to lay these paving
stones. The road is wide and smooth with barely a joint or a seam to be
seen. The street is wide enough for two wagons to pass side by side. A
friendly tavern lies to the south, and the road runs east and west.

are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    The double doors to the west have been carved from a rather ordinary
looking grey stone. Chiseled into one door is a depiction of the Scales of
Balance, and on the other the Book of Gilean. A wrought iron ring hangs
from the doors allowing them to be pulled open. Sconces line the walls
throughout this chamber except for along a plain brick wall to the east.

[36mA Jagged End of the Balcony[0;37m
    The unending rows of bookshelves on this balcony come to an abrupt end
as the smooth stone becomes shattered rubble at your feet. A cave-in from a
failing support column has crushed the bookshelves, balcony, and whatever
is below under tons of solid stone. Traversing across this rubble would not
be easy without a great deal of effort.

east, but all of the bookshelves along the north wall of the library have
been been completely crushed under what looks like a fallen slab of stone
from the balcony above. Not surprisingly the bookshelves along this row
have all been destroyed, and broken remnants of the ancient vallenwood

    A stark contrast to the nearby rows, the bookshelves here have been
reduced to a large pile of rubble blocking passage in some directions. The
shelves that are still visible are broken and covered in dust, with many
books lost to the ages. Far above the bookshelf remnants there are wide
skylights that are dark and barely visible, offering no additional light.
The Aesthetics speak of this section with deep sadness, lamenting the

    It would take a keen eye to find a speck of dust among these
bookshelves after the hard work of the Aesthetics. The shelves appear to go
on forever, housing hundreds of books. Far above the highest shelves the
ceiling appears to have wide skylights which have been covered with earth
and rock. There is an eerie silence about this place, and each footstep
echoes almost eternally.

The head librarian says to you,

        'Are you one of the new hires? Well praise be to Gilean, you
    couldn't have arrived soon enough, we need you to begin work on a
    task immediately. As you most assuredly know already, a few years
    before the Cataclysm the Kingpriest Beldinas and his Order of the
    Divine Hammer instituted the Edict of Thought Control. The Edict
    declared that any texts which conflicted with their faith would be
    destroyed in the name of Paladine. Before the Edict could be
    enforced in our dear library, the heroic Aesthetics of those days
    destroyed the catalogue of books here and sealed up the library to
    keep it safe from Istar's prying eyes. For ages this library had
    been lost, but Gilean has guided our devoted Aesthetics back here
    to restore the catalogue and share centuries of recorded
    knowledge.'

        'There are a few particular books I need you to find for me
    that need to be added to the catalogue. I do hope they are still in
    a readable condition. We are currently cataloguing cultural
    histories and we are looking for a text which describes the
    original races of Krynn, as well as any texts relating to the
    ancient elves. Oh, and I almost forgot the key. This will give you
    access to our storage room should you need any supplies. Praise be
    to the book, and to the balance.'

Wide oak shelves line each wall of the storage room, they are packed full
of materials for the librarians and aesthetics. Some of the obvious
materials are different types of glue, book bindings, papers, some cans of
oil, quill pens and ink cannisters. The shelves are so full of material
that it must take a significant amount of searching to find something
specific.

Wide oak shelves line each wall of the storage room, they are packed full
of materials for the librarians and aesthetics. Some of the obvious
materials are different types of glue, book bindings, papers, some cans of
oil, quill pens and ink cannisters. The shelves are so full of material
that it must take a significant amount of searching to find something
specific.

    The pervasive stench of sewage immediately overwhelms the senses as a
light shower of foul-smelling water falls from above into this knee-level
pool of filth. Dark figures appear to move in and out of the sewage
suggesting there may be creatures dwelling within the murky waters, but
they could also be just a trick of the darkness. Aside from the occasional
echo of voices and the scurry of footsteps there is only the sound of water
flowing in from above.

still the same metal pipe material, this room does not appear to contain any
sewage. Instead of sewage a puddle of blood in the centre of the room
appears to flow westward. The chamber walls are completely covered in
charts, maps, and pages of texts covered in blood-red scrawlings. Heaps of
offal throughout the chamber have been set up like makeshift furniture,
among them an intimidating throne of flesh and bone rests upon a dais of
rotted skulls. A ladder of metal rungs climbs up along the chamber walls to
a hatch with an iron wheel attached which crowns the ceiling.

    The sewer pipe widens into a large round chamber. Though the walls are
still the same metal pipe material, this room does not appear to contain any
sewage. Instead of sewage a puddle of blood in the centre of the room
appears to flow westward. The chamber walls are completely covered in
charts, maps, and pages of texts covered in blood-red scrawlings. Heaps of
offal throughout the chamber have been set up like makeshift furniture,
among them an intimidating throne of flesh and bone rests upon a dais of
rotted skulls. A ladder of metal rungs climbs up along the chamber walls to
a hatch with an iron wheel attached which crowns the ceiling.

    This room serves as a small bathhouse for the library staff, except
instead of baths the room has been built as showers of water that can be
used while standing. A small copper pipe rings the room wall about a foot
from the ceiling, and there are small wheel levers and pipe openings every
few feet allowing individual showers with control over water flow. The
entire room from ceiling to floor is constructed of small white stone tiles
which have been stained brown, pink and black over time from water
minerals. The entire floor is sloped gently toward the centre to allow
water to flow into a central floor drain.

    This simple but elegant hallway is a brief reprieve from the nearby
maze of bookshelves. The hall here is well lit by round glowing orbs which
rest atop silver wall sconces and shine light to every corner and crevice.
It's difficult to discern the material of the sheer white walls to the
north and south, but unlike the rest of this aging library they appear
flawless. There is a large doorway set in the southern wall, an even larger
set of doors to the west lead to the library, and the hallway continues
eastward.

been dutifully replaced with the more austere and simplistic approach one
would expect from a cleric of Gilean. Spaced evenly on the sheer white

organized mahogany desk and a large mahogany bookcase displaying books and

hair has been pulled back into a tight bun, yet frizzy stands of gray still
manage to protrude. The head librarian looks uninterested in you or the

materials are different types of glue, book bindings, papers, some cans of

    The powerful scents of various glues and inks pervade the senses in
this small storage office. Two desks corner this room but thin coats of
dust suggest the room is no longer used as an office. Rows of shelves along
each side of the room are loaded to the brim, but instead of books they
carry supplies for the Aesthetics. Papers of all sizes, bindings of all
kinds, various glues, and a healthy selection of inks and quills are some
of the most common stores here.

    This row of bookshelves appears to have previously run from west to
east, but all of the bookshelves along the north wall of the library have
been been completely crushed under what looks like a fallen slab of stone
from the balcony above. Not surprisingly the bookshelves along this row
have all been destroyed, and broken remnants of the ancient vallenwood
shelves litter the floor. The path to the west is completely impassable due
to the clutter of collapsed shelves and stone debris. To the east the
remains of the fallen slab lay upon the shattered shelves. There is a
significant amount of rubble and debris scattered about the area.
