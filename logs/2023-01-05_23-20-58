We reserve the right to delete or force a player to change his name if we feel
that it is inappropriate. Character names should be chosen in light of the world
in which Dragonlance stories take place. Compound nouns (such as Darkshadow or
Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as Superman or Judgedredd), and
silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)are inappropriate. Characters with
such names will very likely be deleted. In the event you are asked to change
names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite and
courteous: Staff members are here to help maintain a pleasant gaming

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

[36mNowhere[0;37m
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name.

panoramic view of the entire village of Solace. The amazing sight of houses
built on top of vallenwood trees surrounding Solace and connected by a

like smoke piping from Theros' chimney and clusters of people chewing on
spiced potatoes near the Inn of the Last Home offer a taste of all the
different facets of life in Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a neighboring

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

marks the town's western border. A sturdy guard tower stands above you with
constant lookouts maintained at all hours of the day. To the south, a small

majestically above the other buildings in this town. The street swings north
to the west gate and curves gently to the southeast.
