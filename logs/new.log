    The road seems to become worse as you travel, stones litter your way
and the grass grows in the cracks, creating patterns on the floor. Although
it seems that no-one uses this path anymore, there appears to be small hoof
prints, a welcoming sign that there are at least other adventurers close
by, or so you hope. The road continues to the west.
