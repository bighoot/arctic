paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off to
the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.

impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands

Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,

Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest

dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    The chapel is one of the largest and most majestic buildings in Newport.
It is built of fine oak timber and has a few rows of fine wooden pews.
Looking around you see a few statues of some of the gods of the good
pantheon. You recognize Paladine and his sons Kiri-Jolith and Habbakuk.
Placed near Paladine is a statue of Mishakal, the goddess of healing.
Looking to the east you see the lush chapel garden.

up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly

The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

[36mNorthern Avenue[0;37m
    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

[36mA Small Side Street[0;37m
    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

[36mThe Inn of the Last Home[0;37m
    The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace dominates
one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill the
room. A stairway leads up, further into the tree, while another stairway
leads down to the forest below.

    The reception contains a small desk. A long hall leads behind the desk
here and you can tell this is where adventurers rest and take time off from
their journeys. A small stairway goes down towards what appears to be a
lively tavern.
