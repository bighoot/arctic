Spell    : Entangle
Sphere   : Plant
Usage    : cast 'entangle'
Duration : 3 hours/combat rounds
Effects  : Victims are overrun by vines

The caster summons by means of this spell a rapid growth of thorny
vines from the ground around him. Those not grouped with the caster
are sought out by the vines and entangled. Consequently, those
affected are easier to hit and have trouble moving or fleeing from
combat. This spell fails if not cast in natural outdoor surroundings.
