    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    This narrow road runs right up against the western foothills of the
Eastland mountain range. It continues to the north and to the west where it
can be seen cutting a line through the unmolested grass of the Abanasinia
plains. A smaller path branches off the road and leads east here, deeper
into the grassy plains. A short distance to the north west a few strands of
black smoke can be seen rising from the base of the Kharolis mountains.

[36mA Road Through the Plains[0;37m
    A narrow road runs from the north to the south here, paralleling the
Eastwall mountains that rise from the plains a short ways to the east. The
plains also extend to the west where they run into an arm of the Kharolis
mountains. Judging from the height of the grass, you can only assume that
the land sandwiched between these two ranges must be very fertile.

[36mNear the Shore of Newsea[0;37m
    Waves from the Newsea crash onto the shoreline, sending spray of salty
water into the air. Strong gusts from the north whip at your clothes and
kick sand and water droplets into your face. From the eastern horizon to
the western horizon, all that can be seen are the waters of the Newsea.
Directly across the waters to the north you can barely make out a land mass
and a city, it must be Port o'Call. The sand along the shore becomes more
sparse to the south and a road leads away from the shoreline.

    A shady grove offers a cool place to rest at this intersection. The
rolling grasslands to the south extend beyond sight, running parallel to
the forest of Silvanesti. The southern tip of the Khalkist mountains lies a
great distance towards the west, and rise up like towering giants. Beyond
that, though not visible, lies the waters of New Sea. Ogre Peaks and Onyx
Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name
suggests, is home to many ogres. The land to the north is a mighty plain
known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.
Skirting the northern tip of the Silvanesti forest, the road continues east
into the lands of Khur.

The trees and foliage provide an impassable barrier to entering the forest
from here, forming a natural border with the rest of the world. To the east

careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only

    The lands of Ak-Tubal and Kalin Ak-Phan stretch out to the east. They
are flat, dry, grassy plains infamous for their unbearable heat during the
summer solstice. Although the conditions can be harsh, you can see several
clumps of hardwoods providing some shade for travellers. Far east beyond
the huge plains you can barely make out the glittering waves of the Khurman
Sea. The altitude descends north of there, though to the south you can see
the jagged, towering peaks of the mighty Khalkist Mountains.

Mountains which lay to the west. Lush, flat plains extend to the east and

boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or
civilization can be seen in sight, as there are few footprints and no wagon

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side

    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the

varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

kitchen. Over the fire-pit a huge pig is roasting slowly, while at the
stove bread bakes to a fine golden brown. A bookshelf on the southern wall
holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a
priest of Reorx. A window set on the northern wall is open, in the
unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,

A bright red beard and burly muscles are hardly the only things to see when
looking upon this impressive dwarf. His deep green eyes reveal wisdom beyond
his years and a twinkle on his lips reveals a quick wit. Shuba is wearing an
old white apron, covered in old grease stains and singe marks. He sports a
clever looking chef's hat, so that everyone can see who he is.

while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural
wonderland.

    On both sides of a long dried path are huge puddles of a strangely
sweet-smelling mud. Thankfully, the path provides relief from the messy
mud-covered entrance of the stalagmite. Cloved prints pockmark the path,
too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room. The
path leads to the south and north, where a sickening smell seems to be
coming from.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

Lanai flies in from the west.
[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    Viscous streams of the sweet-smelling, orange-tan mud spills forth from
an unseen source above. The result is an absolutely absurd amount of mud in
this room. Looking down, huge body prints have been cast where armaboros
have spent their time recuperating energy. The path to the west looks a
little bit easier to move in, since, here, you are forced to swim.

    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area
below.

    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area
below.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

Large stalagmites, points upward, rise out of the ground forming this

holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a
priest of Reorx. A window set on the northern wall is open, in the
unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the

heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side

Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large

it, both to manufacture products for the shop, as well as larger orders for
King Torak and King Hornfel. The western wall has a large area devoted to
ornamental additions to the smithed products as well as weaving stations
and strange gadgets. On the southern wall a large counter is set up as a

underground plants hang down from the ceiling. It seems like this ancient

    A remarkably sparkly chandelier adds pleasant luminescence to the room.
Instead of glass dangling down from it, fiery rubies glitter adding a red
tinge to the light of the chandelier. Against the northern wall of the
shop, a full smithy is set up. Apprentice and veteran smiths seem to use
it, both to manufacture products for the shop, as well as larger orders for
King Torak and King Hornfel. The western wall has a large area devoted to
ornamental additions to the smithed products as well as weaving stations
and strange gadgets. On the southern wall a large counter is set up as a
payment station, there is also a large exchange box on it. Strange
underground plants hang down from the ceiling. It seems like this ancient
store really sells just about anything a villager would need.

    A clear junction spot of the Main Way, the area is labeled with a huge

Surprisingly, the tunnel east, while plenty big enough for the carts, has
no tracks leading in that direction. Villagers are plentiful in the area of
this junction, some chatting wildly with each other, while others sit on
the benches, which have been erected around the junction sign. Torches
bring an abundance of light to this underground tunnel.

from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large

very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in

at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

[36mThe Main Lift[0;37m
    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a

near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the

    The rocky bend in the mountains is a sort of valley as the taller
mountain peaks all around slope downward. Loose boulders above give an
uneasy feeling, as the mountains funnel to this portion of the road. The
only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs
are unscalable. An indication of civilization comes in the form of a thin
netting that sits along the sloped cliffside to the west, preventing much
of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such
netting to the south.

[36mRoad to Kalaman[0;37m
    You are on a large road traveling through the vast plains that dominate
this region. The plains stretch out in all directions around you. To the
east, the plains give way to a large forest which rises far off the road,
while to the west, the plains seem to extend as far as you can see. The
road you are on leads north to the city of Kalaman, and also winds
southeast through the plains and then into some foothills.

    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

[36mAlong the Walls of the High Clerist Tower[0;37m
    The pathway around the tower walls is quite narrow, allowing very
little movement. This path appears to have been much wider at one point,
but additions to the tower walls have brought it down to just a few feet
wide. Small stones fall from the mountain side above, striking the ground
constantly. Several small cracks are visible in the tower wall here,
indicating a possible weakness in the towers defenses.

    The pathway continues to shrink, what was once a massive highway, is
now little more than a foot trail. The mountain, with its sheer face, and
towering height, stands here, providing an excellent addition to the already
massive tower walls. Small stones rain down from the mountain side, a
possible precursor for things to come. The defenders of the tower can be
heard overhead, marching along the ramparts, ready for battle.

    Looking to the west, a massive stone wall blocks the pass, leaving few
options for movement here. The narrowness of the trail leaves very little
room for maneuvering, and would make a great place for an ambush. The
original highway around the tower has completely fallen apart, the only
remains are several stones in the ground, broken to pieces over time. A
small group of knights can be heard from the ramparts overhead, talking as
they patrol the walls.

    A massive stone wall continues from the tower into the stone face of
the mountain, impeding northbound progress. Moss has begun to grow on the
wall, as upkeep in this area would be a lot of work. A small opening in the
wall appears to have been formed here, leaving just enough room for someone
to pass through. Several sets of footprints, visible in the dirt here, lead
through the opening here, showing that this passage is still traveled.

face of the mountain. The walls that were added to the tower continue right
into the stone face of the mountain here, completely closing off the path.

    You are at the city gates of Palanthas. There really isn't much of a
city wall for Palanthas. The citizens of Palanthas don't think a city wall
is very becoming of their beautiful city, they would rather showcase their
pride and risk their safety. Therefore the city gates are always open.

leaning gently on a walking staff. A small owl is perched on his right
shoulder. The monument to the right looks to be a simple block of granite,
but you sense it is more than that. Stepping closer, you see what appear to
be shatter marks in the otherwise pristine stone. Laying atop the granite
block is what appears to be a mold for the blade and hilt of a sword. The
trees and grass here is severely overgrown, making you wonder when the last

[36mNear the Edge of the Cliff[0;37m
     As you suspected earlier the cliff drops off into a small valley, but
that supposition couldn't have prepared you for what lies within that
valley. Jutting out from beneath the far wall of the valley is the edge of
a building, made from the same stone as the valley walls. You suspect that
it goes much further into the wall, but can't be sure from this distance.
Lying between you and that building is a large field, which looks as though
a war once raged upon it. There are signs of a barricade to your right, a
rock slide to the left, and various pits and traps in between. With sudden
abruptness you realize you are standing on the cliff the young druid
sacrificed his life upon in a final spell to end the Celestial War. Surely
the building hidden under the valley wall must be the Celestial Temple he
was trying to protect.

     Almost as your feet touch the floor of the valley, you feel the air
begin to weigh heavily in your lungs. The odor of centuries old magic and
decades old battles hangs around you like an oppressive blanket. The ground
beneath your feet is a lifeless color, everything that once grew here
having been crushed into oblivion under soldiers' feet years earlier. As
you shuffle your feet to get a better look around, the dust you kick up
begins to mix with the death in the air. The valley walls block your exit
to the west, but the field of battle continues to the east and north. There
appears to be a crystal block immediately north.

    The crystal block you saw from further away is clearly a monument, but
who originally erected it is a mystery. It appears to be made from solid
red crystal, at least on this side. As you run your hands along the almost
frictionless surface, you discover that the block turns to granite halfway
along each side. Gazing atop the statue, you see the figure of a large
Aurinite knight, his shield and sword resting against on the ground before
him, staring passionless at the valley wall. There looks to be a second
figure standing back-to-back with the Aurinite, but you can't tell from
this side. Nor can you easily go around the statue as it takes up the
entire area immediately to the east.

     Something died here, of that there can be little doubt. But you are
just as certain it wasn't one of the Aurinites or Gargoyles. The crevasse
made by the body is far too big to be a soldier, even one of their massive
sizes. It becomes immediately apparent that some kind of large dragon died
here, at least that is the impression you get from examining the crevasse.
What happened to the body and who killed it are questions you don't have
answers for, but at least you now have a glimpse of the killing power of
the Aurinite and Gargoyle armies.

     Though there are no bodies, bones, or traces of blood here, it is
clear the Celestial War once raged across this area of the valley. Pieces
of equipment, weapons, and armour covered with years of dust and decay
litter the floor. None appear to be in any condition that would make them
valuable, even as souvenirs of the war. Judging from the few tracks you can
still see on the ground and the collection of equipment nearby, the battle
that occurred here obviously spilled over into the areas to the south and
west. You can't help wonder what happened to the victims this equipment
once protected from harm.

     Remarkably this small area of the valley appears to have been spared
the ravages the rest of the valley suffered. There is no debris from
equipment or weapons, no signs of any scuffles, and no bodies within sight.
It immediately seems strange to you that this single area was saved from
the Celestial War, but then you notice the faint marks along the ground.
Upon closer examination, they vaguely resemble the marks a broom with stiff
bristles might leave if it were used to sweep the area. It is with some
hesitation you admit to yourself that somebody deliberately cleaned this
area of the valley, though for what reason you can only guess.

access to the north again. There is no sign what caused the rock slide this
far from the wall, but it feels unnatural even from this distance. Whatever
force buried the Celestial Temple beneath the valley walls probably
inadvertently caused this rock slide as well. Though you can travel to the
north, west, and south from here, the area immediately to your east has
been cut off by a large pit. Glancing down into the pit you see a
collection of pointed spears, but there are no bodies on the spears
indicating it was ever successfully used.

     Although the broken and rusted piece of equipment scattered here draw
your attention immediately, your mind eventually focuses on the large pit
immediately to the south. It takes up most of the area to the south and
prevents you from moving in that direction. Glancing over the edge of the
pit, you see a collection of sharp spear point up at you from three meters
below. Given the bits of canvas and dried leaves littering the bottom of
the pit, this was obviously once used as a trap, though which side
constructed it is anybody's guess.

     Like most of the valley, this area is full of broken equipment and
rusted metal, none of it useful anymore. What strikes you, though, is a
collection of ten deep grooves in the ground running from east to west.
Kneeling down to get a better look at them, and coughing momentarily from
the dust kicked up around you, you tentatively place your hand over the
indentations. Although your fingers don't fit perfectly into the grooves,
it is easily conceivable that the fingers of a creature the size of an
Aurinite or Gargoyle could. Obviously someone was dragged through this area
against their will, possibly to the large pit you see to the west.

     Dug into the center of this section of the valley is a spacious pit,
though there doesn't appear to be anyway to climb down into it and still be
able to climb back out. Looking down into it you see it's about half full
with broken down, rusted, and useless equipment from the Celestial War.
Obviously this place is an equipment dump for someone. The question is, why
would anyone gather this unusable equipment in one place? Littering its rim
are stacks of dirt, obviously the ground displaced to dig the pit, and
short stacks of rusted out equipment that have yet to be dumped into it.

     There are two large indentations along the dust covered ground here,
not big enough to be caused by a machine of war, but definitely not
natural. As you lean down to examine them closer, coughing once at the dust
hanging in the air around you, you notice that the grooves are identical in
length and width. You slump your shoulders in concentration, wondering what
could cause such markings, when it suddenly dawns on you. From what you
know of the size of the Gargoyles and Aurinites, they are what would happen
if a soldier who was shoved forcibly into the ground and slid for several
feet, his shoulder blades digging into the ground as he moved.

Gargoyle, his wings spread outward in a battle pose, staring down at you.
There looks to be a second figure standing back-to-back with the Gargoyle,

first you think they might be someone's failed attempt at a message, but
their grim reality quickly sets in. The grooves can only be from the gloved
hand of a soldier trying desperately to claw his way up the wall and
probably failing miserably. There are no signs of a body or blood, making
you think that whatever finally happened to the soldier, it didn't happen
here. The valley walls prevent you from moving to the south or east, but
the field of battle continues joylessly to the north and west. There
appears to be a stone block immediately north.

decades old battles hangs around you like an oppressive blanket. The ground
beneath your feet is a lifeless color, everything that once grew here
having been crushed into oblivion under soldiers' feet years earlier. As
you shuffle your feet to get a better look around, the dust you kick up
begins to mix with the death in the air. The valley walls block your exit

     As you suspected earlier the cliff drops off into a small valley, but
that supposition couldn't have prepared you for what lies within that
valley. Jutting out from beneath the far wall of the valley is the edge of
a building, made from the same stone as the valley walls. You suspect that
it goes much further into the wall, but can't be sure from this distance.
Lying between you and that building is a large field, which looks as though
a war once raged upon it. There are signs of a barricade to your right, a
rock slide to the left, and various pits and traps in between. With sudden
abruptness you realize you are standing on the cliff the young druid
sacrificed his life upon in a final spell to end the Celestial War. Surely
the building hidden under the valley wall must be the Celestial Temple he
was trying to protect.

It doesn't take long to realize you are atop a cliff, though its edge is
immediately to the north. You cannot see what lies beyond from where you

feel a sense of wariness, you cannot locate the source of your discomfort

shoulder. The monument to the right looks to be a simple block of granite,

be shatter marks in the otherwise pristine stone. Laying atop the granite
block is what appears to be a mold for the blade and hilt of a sword. The

estate comes into view. A bridge to the south connects the area you stand
upon to the estate proper over a rushing river of clean, pure water. A
tangle of tall shrubs and bushes lies just after that, grown and raised in
a maze formation. Beyond the shrubs stands the manor itself, towering high
above the countryside. The most direct route to the Thane's palace is down
the hill to the south, while the path leads north towards the main road.

    The beginning of a long bridge lies ahead, connecting the ground
beneath your feet to the actual land of the Thane's manor. A gentle yet
steady river runs east and west, dividing the manor from the rest of the
area. There is some activity on the river near the manor, while the entire
body of water is surely populated with wildlife. The ground features many
footprints and grooves that have been worn into it by peasants and visiting
nobles alike, as well as their wagons and carriages. A blanket of green
grass surrounds the area, filling it with the rich smell of the outdoors.
The bridge lies to the south, and the main road lies further north.

weight of heavy loads, like a farmer's wagon or any procession the manor's
lord might desire. Barely creaking at all, the bridge travels over the
small river beneath and surrounding the manor on all sides. The bridge

beyond the height of a tall man, the maze is still able to give children
and adults alike a good time. The peals of high-pitched laughter
ringing from behind the bright green garden affirm this fact. The manor
stands further to the south, while the bridge patiently waits north.

    The bridge reaches solid ground, which turns into a short path leading
to the entrance of some sort of garden. The main plant seems to be simple
shrubbery, grown in a maze-like fashion. While the bushes only grow just
beyond the height of a tall man, the maze is still able to give children
and adults alike a good time. The peals of high-pitched laughter
ringing from behind the bright green garden affirm this fact. The manor
stands further to the south, while the bridge patiently waits north.

    A sturdy, stable, reliable wooden and metal bridge lies beneath your

elaborately carved and designed silver posts. It is designed to carry the
weight of heavy loads, like a farmer's wagon or any procession the manor's
lord might desire. Barely creaking at all, the bridge travels over the
small river beneath and surrounding the manor on all sides. The bridge
leads both north and south to solid ground.

    The beginning of a long bridge lies ahead, connecting the ground
beneath your feet to the actual land of the Thane's manor. A gentle yet
steady river runs east and west, dividing the manor from the rest of the
area. There is some activity on the river near the manor, while the entire
body of water is surely populated with wildlife. The ground features many
footprints and grooves that have been worn into it by peasants and visiting
nobles alike, as well as their wagons and carriages. A blanket of green
grass surrounds the area, filling it with the rich smell of the outdoors.
The bridge lies to the south, and the main road lies further north.

tangle of tall shrubs and bushes lies just after that, grown and raised in
a maze formation. Beyond the shrubs stands the manor itself, towering high
above the countryside. The most direct route to the Thane's palace is down
the hill to the south, while the path leads north towards the main road.

the narrow passageway might not be the safest way to go. A few cobblestones

    The road slopes gently here, rising slowly as it begins to meet the
Vingaard Mountains. Tall evergreen trees stand nearby, their long, wide
branches swaying gently in the light breeze that blows. Looking west to the
mountains, a few snow-capped peaks are barely visible high above. Down the
road to the east lies the Wings of Habbakuk, a large grassy valley nestled
between the Vingaard Mountains and the Virkhus Hills.

    Situated right between the Vingaard Mountains to the west, and the
Virkhus hills to the east, the Wings of Habbakuk sit below peaks that rise
up high above you. A small creek runs along a portion of the road here, and
then turns away towards a lake at the heart of this lush valley. Tall green
grasses grow all around, beautiful patterns emerging as the wind blows
their tops back and forth. A large bird occasionally flies by high
overhead, searching for prey. The road stretches east and west through the
green valley.

    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

    The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal
place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,
scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

    Passing through the Solamnic Plain, the soft gurgle of the Vingaard can
barely be heard to the northwest. Looking northward along the road, a small
grove of trees can be seen, standing lonely in the flat grasslands of the
plain. A gentle breeze blows, tossing the grasses back and forth, carrying
a slightly sweet smell with it. The road extends south toward Solanthus and
the Newsea, and northward toward Vingaard.

    The Old Road is intersected here by the cobblestone road leading to the
small fishing community, Newport. Beyond Newport is a bay of the New Sea,
its waters stretching out across the horizon. The cobblestone continues to
the north, signifying the beginnings of a major trade route to the towns of
Solace and Haven further to the north. The majestic forests of the fabled
elven capitol of Qualinost deepen to the southwest. If you travel south you
can also come upon Pax Tharkas. If you travel north, you will hit the River
White Rage.

    You find yourself at the beginning of a mountain pass leading into the
Kharolis mountains if you are heading south. This region is known to the
dwarves as Northgate, for it signals the northern entrance into their
mountainous domain. South of here the mountains grow taller and the road
leads to the mountain tops. To the north and east you can see forested
foothills and to the distant west more mountains are visible.

[36mSouthgate[0;37m
    A row of heavy fortifications are arranged facing the southern wall,
designed to protect dwarven warriors in case invaders are somehow able to
break through the giant stone plug known as Southgate. Any invading forces
resilient enough to make it past the first line of defenses will be forced
to suddenly turn right, which makes fighting very awkward for right-handed
fighters, to ascend the huge spiral ramp that leads into Thorbardin.

Spell    : Animate Dead
Sphere   : Necromantic
Usage    : cast 'animate dead' [corpse in room]
Duration : 5 + level hours
Effects  : Animates a corpse

This spell is used to raise a corpse and manipulate it to do the caster's
bidding.  The resulting zombie is completely under the control of the caster,
albeit a little anti-social.  It may be 'ordered' just as a pet or one under
the influence of a powerful charm spell:

>order corpse smile
>The corpse smiles warmly.

Thus it may be used in combat to aid its master. The magical enchantment
however, does not stop the zombies from rotting, hence the effect is only
temporary. Only a limited number of zombies can follow a master at any one
time.

The zombie will take the form of the corpse that is to be animated.  Any
special abilities the zombie had in previous life are negated.  A zombie
will be aggressive only if it had an aggressive nature while alive.

Details:
- Utility spell which reanimates a corpse into a 'grouped' follower of the
  caster.
- Animated corpses have reduced hit points and are weaker than the original
  being from which they are animated.
- Animated corpses cannot wield or offhand weapons.
- Animated corpses can breathe and rest underwater.

This ancient dwarf has been serving her god for many, many years, and her
faith is as unwavering as ever. Despite her obvious old age, she is still
spry and nimble, with divine zeal for her god burning fervently in her eyes
like the fire of Reorx's forge. She wears both a crimson holy symbol and a
hooded robe of dark crimson wool, with runes stitched into its sleeves.
The high priestess of Reorx is in an excellent condition.

    An enormous anvil of red granite stands on a platform suspended over a

divinity carved around the base of the anvil clearly indicate that it is an
altar to Reorx. The altar gleams proudly under the light of huge glittering
diamonds embedded in the domed black ceiling to resemble stars, arranged
like the constellations of Paladine and Takhisis circling each other. The
bridges lead off in each of the cardinal directions, but since the southern

[36mThe Fifteenth Road[0;37m
    Paved with striated granite cobblestones, this broad tunnel is one of
the fabled Roads that makes travel through Thorbardin easy. Merchant and
farming wagons occasionally trundle on by, moving raw materials or finished
goods from one clan's city to another. The Road is wide enough for eight
wagons to pass through, continuing to the east and west from here.

    The giant black iron gate to the south is made of inch-thick bars and
appears to be nigh indestructible. Dwarven runes etched into the dolomite
plaque hanging over the gate proclaim this the entrance to Daerbardin, and
a separate sign opposite the gates indicates that this is the Fifteenth

    Except for a few snoring gully dwarves napping the among rotting crates
on the east side of the wharf the area is deserted. A purple miasma hangs
over the mound of broken crates, but abruptly stops--almost as if a divine
power erected an invisible wall to block the stench. Contrasting the filthy
east, a broad tunnel opens to the south. A large winch system sits upon
the rocky shore, and thick cables stretch across the Urkhan Sea to guide 
mechanized ferries over the lapping water. The sign here says that ferries 
will take passengers to the Life Tree at the center of the Urkhan Sea.

    Built on the limestone island beneath the Life Tree at the center of
Thorbardin, these docks bustle with activity as dwarves from every clan
pass through on the way to the taverns, forges, and shops housed within. A
large winch system sits upon the rocky shore, and thick cables stretch off
across the Urkhan Sea to guide the mechanized ferries over the water. The
sign posted near the winches indicates that ferries leaving from this dock
will deposit passengers near the cities of Agharbardin and Daerbardin.

    The gigantic stalactite known as the Life Tree of the Hylar soars up
from here, widening gradually as it rises towards the shadowy ceiling far
above the Urkhan Sea. The outer surface of the stalactite is covered with
an unusual, iridescent coral which casts a warm light that illuminates the
vast cavern surrounding it. Here at its base, the magnificent stalactite
tapers until it is only as wide around as a dwarven waist where it merges
with the limestone island beneath it. A trio of vertical transport shafts
cut through the center of the Life Tree, and the screeching pulleys of the
steam-powered lifts drown out the sounds coming from the nearby docks.

stop on this level. The high ceiling and the archways leading away from
the station are unusually tall for dwarven architecture, as if this area
is designed to accommodate the needs of bigger races. Sturdy wooden boards
block movement through the archways in all directions except north.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a dwarf steps off on
this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must
have fallen off contraptions being transported to other parts of the huge
mountain kingdom. Unlike gnomish parts, these spare parts are as finely
made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

defend their mountain home and keep their mighty kingdom running.

this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must

made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

from the station. The stone archways and walls are covered with cultivated
mushrooms arranged in beautiful fluorescent patterns. According to a large

    Striking the perfect balance between wildly overgrown and meticulously
cultivated, this garden of mushrooms is a beautiful, psychedelic feast for
the eyes. There is such variety here that it seems like every species of
fungus on the planet--from massive mushrooms to tiny toadstools--is somehow
represented here. The mushrooms grow so thickly, the only way to know where
the garden continues is to try pushing through the wall of fungus.

Short, disheveled, and kind of wretched-looking, this frumpy hylar dwarf
probably never had friends when she was growing up. She always seems to
be mumbling to herself about some fungus or another, talking about topics
that only dwarves steeped in the lore of mycology might have any interest
in. Absently fiddling with a lock of her mold-encrusted hair, she wanders
amongst the toadstools of the garden looking for rare new specimens.

huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and

partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

[36mSouthern Avenue[0;37m
    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill the

    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.
