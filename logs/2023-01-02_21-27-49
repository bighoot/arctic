decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

the road continues. Large bushes block your view to the east and west.

road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the

This is a strange looking Kender indeed, or at least as strange as a Kender
could look without looking as he or she normally does. He looks different
from other Kender, and wears long purple robes, far too big for his size,
which reflect the light almost blindingly. A large, floppy blue hood sits 
atop his head, and a hole has been cut into it so his long, dark brown
topknot can peek out from underneath the fabric. He sits under the apple
tree, entertaining a constant crowd of travelers from the city of Delphon
and Tarsis, or one of the many villages in between. Perhaps you could
listen as well.
The bard is in an excellent condition.

    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

[36mThe Main Lift[0;37m
    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

[36mBottom of the Main Lift[0;37m
    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of
the mountain above. Complicated gears and pulleys seem to work together in
an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

[36mThe Entrance to Deep Mine[0;37m
    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral

popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,

    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west

    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

A dreadful smell of rotten waste inundates the area from the north. Other
than the smell though, little of interest is visible in the direct
vicinity. The thin tunnel continues to the west, while the source of
flagrant odor lies immediately to the north.

Large stalagmites, points upward, rise out of the ground forming this
twisted road through the underground caverns. Vegetation, here, fails to
grow, but some forms of lichen cover the rocks. The road continues to the
east, while to the west a thin tunnel creates a hole to Deep Mine.

    Dark gray walls climb to the ceiling of this massive stalagmite.
Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural
wonderland.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

[36mBehind the Dragon's Skull[0;37m
    Mud puddles line a path, leading directly into the back of a giant
dragon's mouth. A small opening is easily visible between the skull and the
mandible. The mud here has a strange sweet smell that is surprisingly
pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem
terrifyingly bigger than the ones seen above. Most of the hoofprints seem
to be leading east, where the mud gets thicker.

Lanai flies in from the west.
[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

have spent their time recuperating energy. The path to the west looks a

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.

The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

    Viscous streams of the sweet-smelling, orange-tan mud spills forth from
an unseen source above. The result is an absolutely absurd amount of mud in
this room. Looking down, huge body prints have been cast where armaboros
have spent their time recuperating energy. The path to the west looks a
little bit easier to move in, since, here, you are forced to swim.

    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area

[36mA Hot, Muddy Spring[0;37m
    Here the source of the mud, seen throughout the armaboro den, becomes
apparent. A huge spring of hot mud pours forth an endless supply for the
strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the
sweet-smelling mud seem to be quite powerful, as all the beasts in this
region of the den appear exceedingly healthy. The environment is somewhat
intoxicating. You begin to wish that you could just stay here forever. Of
course, considering the size of the bodyprints near the spring, you may
just get your wish. The mud from the spring spills down into the area
below.

    Viscous streams of the sweet-smelling, orange-tan mud spills forth from
an unseen source above. The result is an absolutely absurd amount of mud in
this room. Looking down, huge body prints have been cast where armaboros

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the

secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern

[36mJunction One[0;37m
    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

Surprisingly, the tunnel east, while plenty big enough for the carts, has
no tracks leading in that direction. Villagers are plentiful in the area of
this junction, some chatting wildly with each other, while others sit on
the benches, which have been erected around the junction sign. Torches
bring an abundance of light to this underground tunnel.

it, both to manufacture products for the shop, as well as larger orders for
King Torak and King Hornfel. The western wall has a large area devoted to
ornamental additions to the smithed products as well as weaving stations
and strange gadgets. On the southern wall a large counter is set up as a
payment station, there is also a large exchange box on it. Strange
underground plants hang down from the ceiling. It seems like this ancient

some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a neighboring
vallenwood tree.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

sparse to the south and a road leads away from the shoreline.

to the west. The sandy beach leads eastwards and comes to a trailhead,
leading through some verdant rolling hills. The sky is partially cloudy,
and a drizzle of rain can be felt from time to time.

staining the sand with moisture. Far to the southeast, beyond the hills,
the terrain opens up into a vast desert known as the Plains of Dust. There
is almost a distinguishable line where the sands from the plains meets the
grass at the edge of the hills. The sun warms the hills, but some light
gray rain clouds can be seen moving in from the west.

rolling grasslands to the south extend beyond sight, running parallel to
the forest of Silvanesti. The southern tip of the Khalkist mountains lies a
great distance towards the west, and rise up like towering giants. Beyond
that, though not visible, lies the waters of New Sea. Ogre Peaks and Onyx
Teeth comprise the portion of the mountains to the west, and as the name
suggests, is home to many ogres. The land to the north is a mighty plain
known as Blode, where cities lie sprawled amidst the Khalkist mountains.
Skirting the northern tip of the Silvanesti forest, the road continues east

The trees and foliage provide an impassable barrier to entering the forest
from here, forming a natural border with the rest of the world. To the east
and west, a well travelled path continues east along the edge of the forest,
and west to an intersection. To the north, you can see the plains of Blode
in the distance, which are home to towns and cities alike.

    The trail continues to the east and west, along the edge of the Forest
of Silvanesti. Tall timbers line the sides of the path that creates a
quaint corridor effect. The trees seem to thin out here, giving way to a
more verdant landscape of various shrubbery. Animals trails intersect the
main path leading through the area. Mountain ranges are barely visible to
the north and to the east the terrain seems more rigid and bare. Traveling
here seems peaceful and unencumbered.

the area. The lush forests to the south evoke a sense of peacefulness.
Mountains line the horizon to the north and rolling deserts far to the
east, while thick tree cover to the south denotes the legendary forests of
Silvanesti. An unkempt trail lingers from moderate traffic to the east and
west.

    The cruel sun beats down on the road here, cracking the dried soil.
The land here suffers badly from the unrelenting winds that blow across the
desert to the west. Lizards take shelter in the shadows of the rocks where
the sand is not hot enough to roast them, but there is no shade large
enough for larger animals. Each step sinks into the searing sand, the air
thick and hazy, each breath like drowning in lava.

    The beating sun bakes the dirt road in such heat that the road has
cracked into what almost resembles cobblestones. Insects scurry across,
careful not to stay in the heat for long, lest they become a permanent
melted fixture of the road. Shimmering waves of heat rise off of the road,
distorting your vision slightly. Far to the east, the lands of Khur lie
between here and the Balifor Bay, though all that can be seen is desert.
Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both
Dwarven and Solamnic architecture. Often used as a stopping point for
caravans and trade wagons, Pashin is rumored to have one of the finest
bazaars in Ansalon. There is no shade in this stretch of road, and the only
option is to continue either north or south.

    The road begins to narrow to the north as it grows steadily steeper.
Far in the distance, the road winds as it carves a path through the
foothills of the Khalkists. Vegetation is less sparse further up the
path, offering more sights for the arduous climb. The view to the south is
a stark contrast, as the road widens and flattens. For miles the road
continues straight with very little to see except for an expansive yellow
sea of sand.

    This narrow road winds a treacherous path through these grim foothills.
The trail is rocky and somewhat unstable, through clumps of pine trees and
the occasional hardwood, though other than that the terrain is rather
monotonous. The land is hilly, though not altogether rugged, as most of the
hillsides that comprise the area are grassy or covered with small rocks.
The jagged, violent peaks of the Khalkist Mountains sneer at you high
above to the north.

    The narrow road twists and winds around the larger foothills here.
These hills are the southern extent of the mightly Khalkist Mountains which
loom over you to the north. The peaks are such a bleak, dark grey, they
almost look charred against the sky. To the south the rocky road flattens
somewhat into more hilly foothills while those to the north only become
more treacherous and rocky. In the distance you can see faint signs of
smoke barely rising above the foothills far to the southwest.

are flat, dry, grassy plains infamous for their unbearable heat during the
summer solstice. Although the conditions can be harsh, you can see several
clumps of hardwoods providing some shade for travellers. Far east beyond

Sea. The altitude descends north of there, though to the south you can see

boulder, probably the result of a recent avalanche. No signs of life or

the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the

    Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanse of grasses is this cool
road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east towards
the Khurman Sea and west towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to be a
favored resting place of travelers, as there are several charred circles
near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the
elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of the waves
of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the

correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will

an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west

Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

otherwise dim tunnel. From within the Burrow, noises continuously erupt
signifying a regularly boisterous patronage. The tunnel extending from this
point appears to be less often travelled than the large Main Way of the
city. A faint smell of decay wafts into the room from the north.

    Unadorned with austerity, the thin tunnel serves as an alleyway in the

the dwarves use this part of town for some waste disposal programs. The

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural
wonderland.

    On both sides of a long dried path are huge puddles of a strangely
sweet-smelling mud. Thankfully, the path provides relief from the messy
mud-covered entrance of the stalagmite. Cloved prints pockmark the path,
too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room. The

    On both sides of a long dried path are huge puddles of a strangely
sweet-smelling mud. Thankfully, the path provides relief from the messy
mud-covered entrance of the stalagmite. Cloved prints pockmark the path,
too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room. The

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the

    Mud puddles line a path, leading directly into the back of a giant
dragon's mouth. A small opening is easily visible between the skull and the
mandible. The mud here has a strange sweet smell that is surprisingly
pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem
terrifyingly bigger than the ones seen above. Most of the hoofprints seem
to be leading east, where the mud gets thicker.

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

strange beasts, which have taken up residence here. The effects of the

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

mud-covered entrance of the stalagmite. Cloved prints pockmark the path,
too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room. The
path leads to the south and north, where a sickening smell seems to be

Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below

it, both to manufacture products for the shop, as well as larger orders for
King Torak and King Hornfel. The western wall has a large area devoted to
ornamental additions to the smithed products as well as weaving stations

into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

cresting over the low protective wall that encircles the town. Nestled
close to the black beast of the Khalkists, the town looks truly fitting in
such a dark place. The road leads off to the north, leading through the
badlands. The mountains rise high above eastwards.

    The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

Knight's Spur, a much more recent addition, stretches out across the
northern exit of the pass, protecting the city of Palanthas that lies
beyond. A few snow-capped peaks of the Vingaard Mountains can be seen in

[36mAlong the Walls of the High Clerist Tower[0;37m
    The pathway around the tower walls is quite narrow, allowing very
little movement. This path appears to have been much wider at one point,
but additions to the tower walls have brought it down to just a few feet
wide. Small stones fall from the mountain side above, striking the ground
constantly. Several small cracks are visible in the tower wall here,
indicating a possible weakness in the towers defenses.

    The pathway continues to shrink, what was once a massive highway, is
now little more than a foot trail. The mountain, with its sheer face, and
towering height, stands here, providing an excellent addition to the already
massive tower walls. Small stones rain down from the mountain side, a
possible precursor for things to come. The defenders of the tower can be
heard overhead, marching along the ramparts, ready for battle.

    Looking to the west, a massive stone wall blocks the pass, leaving few
options for movement here. The narrowness of the trail leaves very little
room for maneuvering, and would make a great place for an ambush. The
original highway around the tower has completely fallen apart, the only
remains are several stones in the ground, broken to pieces over time. A
small group of knights can be heard from the ramparts overhead, talking as
they patrol the walls.

[36mAt a Massive Stone Wall[0;37m
    A massive stone wall continues from the tower into the stone face of
the mountain, impeding northbound progress. Moss has begun to grow on the
wall, as upkeep in this area would be a lot of work. A small opening in the
wall appears to have been formed here, leaving just enough room for someone
to pass through. Several sets of footprints, visible in the dirt here, lead
through the opening here, showing that this passage is still traveled.

    The path around the massive walls of the tower is, in reality, little

walls, leaving just a few feet of clearance between the walls and the stone
face of the mountain. The walls that were added to the tower continue right
into the stone face of the mountain here, completely closing off the path.

wall, possibly allowing passage around the tower.

been blocked off by the additions to the towers defensive walls.

     The stream gets a bit rough as it flows out into the ocean. The rapids
ahead looks too dangerous to brave. Small hills line either sides of the
wide stream, rocky and rough, they aren't very suitable for growing crops.
There is a small clearing off the stream just to the south, and you see a
narrow path through the trees to the north, but it doesn't look like it has
been maintained over the years.

obviously been trying to wash away its existence for some time and appear
to be succeeding. The path is all but obscured by the weeds growing in it.
The path appears to continue to the north, but it is hard to tell from

     On either side of the path, hidden behind two short trees so they

monument to the left is of a solitary man, his face shrouded by his cloak,
leaning gently on a walking staff. A small owl is perched on his right
shoulder. The monument to the right looks to be a simple block of granite,
but you sense it is more than that. Stepping closer, you see what appear to
be shatter marks in the otherwise pristine stone. Laying atop the granite
block is what appears to be a mold for the blade and hilt of a sword. The
trees and grass here is severely overgrown, making you wonder when the last
time someone was through this area.

impossible to tarnish its unremarkable appearance. To the north you see
what look like two small towers made of granite and crystal, each

     As you suspected earlier the cliff drops off into a small valley, but
that supposition couldn't have prepared you for what lies within that
valley. Jutting out from beneath the far wall of the valley is the edge of
a building, made from the same stone as the valley walls. You suspect that
it goes much further into the wall, but can't be sure from this distance.
Lying between you and that building is a large field, which looks as though
a war once raged upon it. There are signs of a barricade to your right, a
rock slide to the left, and various pits and traps in between. With sudden
abruptness you realize you are standing on the cliff the young druid
sacrificed his life upon in a final spell to end the Celestial War. Surely
the building hidden under the valley wall must be the Celestial Temple he
was trying to protect.

beneath your feet is a lifeless color, everything that once grew here
having been crushed into oblivion under soldiers' feet years earlier. As
you shuffle your feet to get a better look around, the dust you kick up

red crystal, at least on this side. As you run your hands along the almost
frictionless surface, you discover that the block turns to granite halfway
along each side. Gazing atop the statue, you see the figure of a large
Aurinite knight, his shield and sword resting against on the ground before
him, staring passionless at the valley wall. There looks to be a second
figure standing back-to-back with the Aurinite, but you can't tell from

litter the floor. None appear to be in any condition that would make them

It immediately seems strange to you that this single area was saved from

force buried the Celestial Temple beneath the valley walls probably
inadvertently caused this rock slide as well. Though you can travel to the

seem deliberately sorted into piles of similar items. Weapons have been

your view of the rest of the valley is the same rock slide you saw from the
edge of the valley. But something seems wrong about where you are standing.
It takes you a moment to realize what it is, and a moment longer for the
oppressive dust to settle. This area of the valley has been thoroughly
cleaned of the remains from the Celestial War. There are no signs of broken
equipment or weaponry. The ground even seems to have been well swept to
clear the excess rubble caused from the rock slide.

bolt strikes given the pattern of them. You find that your attention is
drawn away from the rock slide and to the north, though. A large gate made
of white metal stands before you. A sign hangs on the side of the gate, but
it is in a language you do not understand. Looking through the gate and

valley. There are broken swords, rusted out piece of armour, and various
other pieces of equipment badly in need of repairs. But the war remains
seem deliberately sorted into piles of similar items. Weapons have been
sorted from armour and clothing. By the amount of dust that has collected
on the piles, you guess that whoever did this did so shortly after the war
ended and then left them here unattended.

far from the wall, but it feels unnatural even from this distance. Whatever
force buried the Celestial Temple beneath the valley walls probably
inadvertently caused this rock slide as well. Though you can travel to the
north, west, and south from here, the area immediately to your east has
been cut off by a large pit. Glancing down into the pit you see a
collection of pointed spears, but there are no bodies on the spears
indicating it was ever successfully used.

It immediately seems strange to you that this single area was saved from
the Celestial War, but then you notice the faint marks along the ground.
Upon closer examination, they vaguely resemble the marks a broom with stiff
bristles might leave if it were used to sweep the area. It is with some
hesitation you admit to yourself that somebody deliberately cleaned this
area of the valley, though for what reason you can only guess.

     Though there are no bodies, bones, or traces of blood here, it is
clear the Celestial War once raged across this area of the valley. Pieces
of equipment, weapons, and armour covered with years of dust and decay
litter the floor. None appear to be in any condition that would make them
valuable, even as souvenirs of the war. Judging from the few tracks you can
still see on the ground and the collection of equipment nearby, the battle
that occurred here obviously spilled over into the areas to the south and
west. You can't help wonder what happened to the victims this equipment
once protected from harm.

who originally erected it is a mystery. It appears to be made from solid
red crystal, at least on this side. As you run your hands along the almost
frictionless surface, you discover that the block turns to granite halfway
along each side. Gazing atop the statue, you see the figure of a large
Aurinite knight, his shield and sword resting against on the ground before
him, staring passionless at the valley wall. There looks to be a second
figure standing back-to-back with the Aurinite, but you can't tell from
this side. Nor can you easily go around the statue as it takes up the

decades old battles hangs around you like an oppressive blanket. The ground
beneath your feet is a lifeless color, everything that once grew here
having been crushed into oblivion under soldiers' feet years earlier. As
you shuffle your feet to get a better look around, the dust you kick up
begins to mix with the death in the air. The valley walls block your exit
to the west, but the field of battle continues to the east and north. There
appears to be a crystal block immediately north.

     As you suspected earlier the cliff drops off into a small valley, but
that supposition couldn't have prepared you for what lies within that
valley. Jutting out from beneath the far wall of the valley is the edge of
a building, made from the same stone as the valley walls. You suspect that
it goes much further into the wall, but can't be sure from this distance.
Lying between you and that building is a large field, which looks as though
a war once raged upon it. There are signs of a barricade to your right, a
rock slide to the left, and various pits and traps in between. With sudden
abruptness you realize you are standing on the cliff the young druid
sacrificed his life upon in a final spell to end the Celestial War. Surely
the building hidden under the valley wall must be the Celestial Temple he
was trying to protect.

shoulder. The monument to the right looks to be a simple block of granite,
but you sense it is more than that. Stepping closer, you see what appear to

block is what appears to be a mold for the blade and hilt of a sword. The

to be succeeding. The path is all but obscured by the weeds growing in it.
The path appears to continue to the north, but it is hard to tell from
here. To the south you hear the trickle of the stream.

     The stream gets a bit rough as it flows out into the ocean. The rapids
ahead looks too dangerous to brave. Small hills line either sides of the
wide stream, rocky and rough, they aren't very suitable for growing crops.
There is a small clearing off the stream just to the south, and you see a
narrow path through the trees to the north, but it doesn't look like it has
been maintained over the years.

face of the mountain. Although it is possible to squeeze along the walls,
the narrow passageway might not be the safest way to go. A few cobblestones
still remain from the path that went around the tower, but the path has

room for maneuvering, and would make a great place for an ambush. The
original highway around the tower has completely fallen apart, the only
remains are several stones in the ground, broken to pieces over time. A
small group of knights can be heard from the ramparts overhead, talking as
they patrol the walls.

Knight's Spur, a much more recent addition, stretches out across the
northern exit of the pass, protecting the city of Palanthas that lies
beyond. A few snow-capped peaks of the Vingaard Mountains can be seen in

    You stand atop one of the hilltops the road passes over, looking
around. Little is visible nearby other than the rolling grasslands and the
hills, many of which rise a bit higher. The road beneath your feet is very
worn and obviously heavily traveled. A breeze blows gently, delivering
fresh air scented lightly from the surrounding grasses. The road stretches
west through the hills towards the Vingaard Mountains, and east towards the
Solamnic Plains.

The air is clean and refreshing. The road extends westward through the

    The road continues from here, traveling to the north and south. The

Virkhus hills lie to the west and north. Tall grasses along side sway
gently in the wind. The Knights' High Road, the main link between Vingaard
to the east and Palanthas to the west, extends eastward far beyond your
vision. The road is wide and obviously heavily traveled, though traffic
seems to be dwindling as reports of war gain credibility.

highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall plants and weeds.
The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of fire.

winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard

a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

    What road there is disappears in the drifting volcanic ash, so that to
the north only a path remains. To the south, a poorly visible road hugs the
side of the volcano, curving out of sight. The air is smoky, and every now
and then a slight tremor shakes the ground under your feet.

    Bits of ashes blow across the road, emissions from the huge volcano to
the south west. The road skirts the base of the volcano, and its potholes
become treacherous as they slowly fill up with soft ash and become hidden.
All around other bare jagged peaks tower about, casting harsh shadows over

    The road cuts through the mighty Khalkists, covered in the prints of
many boots. The road leads north past the heart of the Khalkists and south
towards the dark city of Neraka. The mountain range looms high above,
craggy and barren. Birds of prey can be seen hovering above, waiting for
the carnage of war. The air is filled with a thick film, possibly coming
from one of the semi-active volcanoes in the region.

Takhisis filling the streets. A twisted dark spire rises in the middle of
the city, the pinnacle of the Queen's temple. The craggy peaks of the
Khalkist mountains rise around the city, adding their shadows to the film
of ash that floats through the air.

almost completely lost in shadow. The roughly hewn cobbles are covered with
filth and trash, and the path probably hasn't been cleaned in months. More
care has been taken in hewing the stones used to make the massive walls,

the area, and it would be unwise to linger here longer than necessary. The
dirty cobblestone path continues to the east and west, while an ominously
narrow passage between the looming walls leads to the south from here. Off
to the north, a rocky path leads into the mighty Khalkist mountains.

    Although the rocks on the hillsides appear much larger than before, you
are relieved to see that some sort of netting covers most of them. Almost
invisible to the eye, the netting keeps them all in place and makes passage
safer for the traveller. The trail leads east onto a path or west through
the rocky hills.

    The rocky bend in the mountains is a sort of valley as the taller
mountain peaks all around slope downward. Loose boulders above give an
uneasy feeling, as the mountains funnel to this portion of the road. The
only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs
are unscalable. An indication of civilization comes in the form of a thin
netting that sits along the sloped cliffside to the west, preventing much
of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such
netting to the south.

    Hot, dry flatlands expand around you. The days in the Alan-Ak Khan are
usually lazy, drifting lazily by into history as the sun beats down. This
crossroad is well traveled, both by Green Dragonarmy patrols and merchants
alike. Delphon sprawls out to the west, while the city of Flotsam sits on
the Blood Sea northeast of here. Southeast of these parched flatlands, Port
Balifor abuts the Khurman Sea. As an area of heavy trade, it is no wonder
that bandits frequent these roads.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out

at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

stand is covered by a small tarp and looks like it would fold up and lock

and stands can be seen, all with wonderous objects to sell. The market
isn't too large, but it does extend to the east for a little ways. A small

vegetables. Vera's stand is quaint by normal standards, but out right
lavish by the standards of this fish market. There are actually some
decorations on the walls, tapestries, paintings and even a flower basket.
The vegetables range from great to fair condition, but the lovely decor
makes everything look just a little bit better.

    The sounds and smells of a market surround the area. Quite a few shops
and stands can be seen, all with wonderous objects to sell. The market
isn't too large, but it does extend to the east and west from this spot.
The bustle of the market can't manage to drown out the sounds of the docks
which are ways off to the west. A vegetable stand has been setup just south
of here by one of the nearby farmers. What appears to be a fishing supply

    The store looks more like a sewing shop than a fisherman's hang out.
There are many tables and stools strewn about, with large nets in all
degrees of disrepair sitting on top of them. Some small poles are in a rack
on the backwall, no line or hooks on them, apparently they need a bit of
work. A small table sits at the front of the store full of items that are
ready to be bought.

serve a much more malevolent purpose. This alley has become a storage

to the east. Piles of disregarded fish pieces litter the area, other
unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting

building to the north and the town wall to the south, but they seem to
serve a much more malevolent purpose. This alley has become a storage
center for the refuse of both the dockyards to the west and the fish market
to the east. Piles of disregarded fish pieces litter the area, other
unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting
development this alley has become over the years.

This alley has been kept clean and well lit, probably by the owners of the

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

torture instruments scattered about. Uncooperative prisoners often find

onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.
