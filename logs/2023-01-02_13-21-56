    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

[36mTraders Square[0;37m
    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

    A very nice surprise in the midst of the market, the Gilded Parrot is a
quaint little inn. The receptionist desk is made of a beautiful piece of

leads up to the rooms just behind the desk. The railing on the staircase is
also of oak with beautiful workmanship on it as well. A rather loud tavern
can be heard to the north, the sounds of enjoyment waft through the door
and wash over the inn's lobby.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The

inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.

here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    A few sleeping recruits pay little attention to your being here,
fatigued from long hours of training in the lower floors. Lumpy bunks
covered in wiry grey sheets stand stacked closed together, almost rising up
to the ceiling. Small footlockers are wedged underneath the bottom bunks,
containing the recruits' only worldly possessions. The line of cots runs
east and south from here, where more recruits doze peacefully.

    Thrifty blankets cover the stacked beds here, occasionally rising and

out from underneath the bottom bunks, their flimsy metal frames barely
protecting the recruits' only belongings. The barrack continues westward,
and to the south a stone archway leads into a twisting hall.

of a mess hall. Two stone archways lead openly to the north and west, into
the soldiers' barracks. A chilling breeze runs through the hallway,

    Thick cracks full of crumbling rock run through the stony walls, and
the air is heavy with wetness. The walls are carved from the earth, and
partially supported by rotting wooden beams that are wedged between the
floor and ceiling. An iron staircase creaks and strains under it's own
weight, sending shrill echoes through the cavernous cellar. Just barely
able to light the room, a few near extinguished torches flicker on the
walls. West of here the cellar intersects, heading off in two more
directions, and through the stairwell you can climb up to the first
subterranean floor of the building.

    Two halls run perpendicular through the cellar here, one due north and

on the southern wall, joined by a few that have burnt out and no longer
serve any purpose. The inherent dampness in the air is obvious here, grungy
water trickles through a narrow crack to the west and spills onto the
floor. Thriving in the moisture, little insects burrow through the rotting
wood beams along the ceiling and walls, adding to their struggle to support
the massive building overhead.

stone ceiling, though some are becoming warped and bowed by stress. Light
is plentiful here, provided by a few newly lit torches attached to the

    Strong magic ripples through your body here, flowing out of the walls
in invisible waves. The obsidian walls of the tower itself glow with an
eerie and unnatural light, defeating the use of having any torches here.
Your eyes tear from strong chemicals in the air, mostly flowing in from a
tall stairway to your north. Boxing you in on both sides, smooth glass-like
walls form a hallway, forcing you either to an intersection north or back
out of the tower south.

[36mThe Base of a Black Tower[0;37m
    By far the most noticeable feature of this area is a tower to the
northwest. Its rounded base protrudes into this room, with a sturdy metal
door allowing access to its obsidian walls. Rising up to and through the
ceiling, the tower almost looks ancient and must have been erected first,
with the building constructed around it. There is a strange odor in the air
here, though the distinct smell of blood wafts in from the east, there is
another peculiar one that is hard to finger and becomes increasingly strong
nearer the tower.

    Sprawling out before you is a massive underground training facility,
broken weapons lie scattered about and the walls are scarred with deep cuts
and cracks. Further to the east you can make out another room set within
the center of the grounds, and on the northern side a few makeshift walls
and tanned leather hides corner off what looks like a medical facility. The
smell of fresh blood invades your nose, surging from east to west in a
putrid breeze. Northwest of you the massive base of a black tower shoots up
through the ceiling.

black walls rise up in this cornered off room, up to the very apex of the
tower. Overhead the only ceiling is that of the sky, the top of the tower
has been partially removed to give a view of the heavens. Standing tall
within the dark glassy wall to your south is a door of iridescent metal
door which leads out of these chambers. Around the curved edge of the room
a scorched table of wood circles around the room, upon which various
magical experiments of the archmage lie stewing in their bottles. A sharp

warmth into this otherwise dreary tower.

door allowing access to its obsidian walls. Rising up to and through the

another peculiar one that is hard to finger and becomes increasingly strong

    Open doorways lead north and south from here, and a dark wood paneled
hallway runs straight to the east. Taking up a majority of the western wall
is a gate of light brown stone, set into a smooth archway that stands as
tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though
the safest path is anyone's guess.

[36mBefore a Gate[0;37m
    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    The tunnel here is not naturally lit, but a dim blue light emanating
from the east reflects like tiny stars off of the moist walls, although it
is not enough to see in the darkness. The coarse walls meet in a corner to
the southwest, and draw the tunnel on to the north and east.

    The tunnel takes an abrupt turn here, leading into darkness both south

source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the
tunnel continues into darkness.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor

    The sounds and smells of a market surround the area. Quite a few shops
and stands can be seen, all with wonderous objects to sell. The market
isn't too large, but it does extend to the west for a little bit. The
market is not so crowded at this point, the number of stores is quite low
here. A small fruit stand is just north. A short alley sits to the south,
it is well lit, but still a little spooky.

[36mThe Gilded Parrot Inn[0;37m
    A very nice surprise in the midst of the market, the Gilded Parrot is a
quaint little inn. The receptionist desk is made of a beautiful piece of
oak with large birds carved into the front and sides. A small stair case
leads up to the rooms just behind the desk. The railing on the staircase is
also of oak with beautiful workmanship on it as well. A rather loud tavern
can be heard to the north, the sounds of enjoyment waft through the door
and wash over the inn's lobby.

    The sounds and smells of a market surround the area. Quite a few shops
and stands can be seen, all with wonderous objects to sell. The market
isn't too large, but it does extend to the east and west from this spot.
The bustle of the market can't manage to drown out the sounds of the docks
which are ways off to the west. A vegetable stand has been setup just south
of here by one of the nearby farmers. What appears to be a fishing supply
store stands to the north.

    The store looks more like a sewing shop than a fisherman's hang out.
There are many tables and stools strewn about, with large nets in all
degrees of disrepair sitting on top of them. Some small poles are in a rack
on the backwall, no line or hooks on them, apparently they need a bit of
work. A small table sits at the front of the store full of items that are
ready to be bought.

    The smell of fish dominates even this area full of a wide assortment of
vegetables. Vera's stand is quaint by normal standards, but out right
lavish by the standards of this fish market. There are actually some
decorations on the walls, tapestries, paintings and even a flower basket.
The vegetables range from great to fair condition, but the lovely decor
makes everything look just a little bit better.

[36mFelipe's Fish Fry[0;37m
    The sound of sizzling fish fills the air and the smell is not far
behind. A wave of heat washes over the front of the store, emanating from
the rear. A few large grills have been set up in the back of the store to
cook up every kind of fish imaginable. A few tables sit in the front of the
store for patrons to sit and enjoy their meals. A small sign has been
posted on the back wall. A bustling market is accessible to the south.

    The sounds and smells of a market surround the area. Quite a few shops
and stands can be seen, all with wonderous objects to sell. The market
isn't too large, but it does extend to the east for a little ways. A small
alley to the west seems to head away from the shops and toward the docks. A
small shop is to the north with a large wooden sign hanging just above the
entryway. A stand full of fresh fish can be seen to the south.

    A stench has come to rest in this small path, a stench that is
uncommonly rank. The smell of fish permeates the air and dominates all
thoughts. The cobblestones underfoot are part of a small alley between a
building to the north and the town wall to the south, but they seem to
serve a much more malevolent purpose. This alley has become a storage
center for the refuse of both the dockyards to the west and the fish market
to the east. Piles of disregarded fish pieces litter the area, other
unmentionable objects can be seen in every nook. What a revolting
development this alley has become over the years.

fishermen.

    A very nice surprise in the midst of the market, the Gilded Parrot is a

also of oak with beautiful workmanship on it as well. A rather loud tavern
can be heard to the north, the sounds of enjoyment waft through the door
and wash over the inn's lobby.

    The sounds and smells of a market surround the area. Quite a few shops
and stands can be seen, all with wonderous objects to sell. The market
isn't too large, but it does extend to the west for a little bit. The
market is not so crowded at this point, the number of stores is quite low
here. A small fruit stand is just north. A short alley sits to the south,
it is well lit, but still a little spooky.

    The further away from the docks and fish stands, the less likely the
smell is to invade the area. This stand has almost avoided the fishy smell
altogether, there is even a hint of apple in the air. The fruits are
displayed on a wooden cart and lined up in rows. The stand is in shambles,
but the fruit appears to be in peak form, ripe and free from bruises.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and

alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Looming at ceiling's height at the southern wall is a lifelike statue
of a dragon with five heads, standing upon a dais. Pews run across the room
parallel to the altar of Takhisis, supplying clerics of the evil goddess
with a place to worship. In between pews, hemp pallets stretch the length
of the room for devotees to kneel in the presence of their deity.

    Narrow isles lead in between the wooden pews from north to south,
heading up to the base of an altar dedicated to Takhisis, which takes up
the entire southern wall of this wide room. Light tan pallets of woven hemp
line the rows of pews from east to west, upon which Takhisis's acolytes
kneel to offer her dark prayers. Leading west is an entryway into a
hallway, occupied by two black wooden doors, one bearing a carving of a
beautiful woman and the other a hideous dragon with five heads.

twists off heading south. Light breezes whisper in through slat-like

pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing

'Death Row'.

executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
