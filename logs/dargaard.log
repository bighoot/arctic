brains. He has survived his wandering lifestyle only by using the robust
physique the dark gods left him with.

    A narrow path cuts in from the west and turns abruptly to the south
just before it hits a yawning chasm. Luckily, a tall ridge of black stone
prevents anyone from accidentally walking over the edge of the path and
falling to their deaths. Branches are haphazardly scattered across the
path, and a chill wind suddenly sweeps past you. Off in the distance, a
burned-out castle stands atop a cliff on the other side of the chasm.
