    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    This well-trod path through Que-teh Village allows easy access to the
few larger and more populated tents of the encampment. It also provides the
major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. There is always someone
wandering around this path, be it the occasional farmer or group of
children playing contentedly. However, the threat of the dragonarmy looms
over the village at all times, and there is an underlying air of constant
alert.

Numerous tents of varying sizes can be seen in all directions. While on the
surface this village appears to be somewhat permanent, closer inspection
reveals that if desired the Que-teh could easily break camp and move to a

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and

foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    The passage is barely passable, but it can be done. To the west, giant
boulder glowers at the road. To the north, the passage continues, while
some ruined gates lie southward. Two passes are cut into the middle of the
passage towards the east and west. The remnants of an abandoned stable sit
to the west, while it's unclear what lies beyond the pass to the east.

[36mBefore Some Ruined Brass Gates[0;37m
    Before you stand two huge brass gates which once guarded the entrance
to Thorbardin. However, a terrible earthquake has caused the passageway
beyond the gates to collapse, sealing off the entrance forever. The giant
gates have fallen off their hinges and lean forlornly against the piles of
rubble. Although the passage into the kingdom is destroyed, the indomitable
mountain known as Cloudseeker still stands, reaching towards the sky. To
the north and south, narrow paths lead around the cliffs surrounding the
mountain, and a sloping path to the east leads back down the mountain.

[36mA Tight Passage[0;37m
    The passage way between the mountain walls and the piles of boulders
is just wide enough for a fair-size adventuring party to pass through. The
boulders look unsteady and you would hate to have to climb up on them, but
thankfully don't look like there will be an avalanche. To the north, the
path opens up and you can see a set of ruined gates, while to the south,
the tight passageway continues through the barren mountain range.

see the passageways are much tighter. To the north, there is a passage
between the walls of the mountain and a bunch of boulders and rubble piled
high. Westward, a small path winds its way into the depths of the Kharolis

a steep, but usable path leads down to the road near Tarsis.

    This humble abode is a pretty standard middle-class dwarven home. Its
occupant is neither extravagantly rich nor wretchedly poor, so the simple
furniture is well-made and functional, but not ornate. The house is very

[36mSouth Hall of Justice[0;37m
    This great hall is where the royal officers make major decisions about
justice that govern the whole kingdom of Thorbardin. As the dwarven society
is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the
god Reorx, this hall also functions as the dwarves' most holy temple. Giant
marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. The south
side of the hall has caved in, and the dwarves have not repaired it yet. A
door to the west must lead to some private chambers, while rubies set into 
the ground lead towards the arched bridge to the holy altar to the east.

    This great hall is where the royal officers make major decisions about
justice that govern the whole kingdom of Thorbardin. As the dwarven society
is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the
god Reorx, this hall also functions as the dwarves' most holy temple. Giant
marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. A pair of
massive bronze doors guard the entrance to the north, while rubies set into
the ground lead towards the arched bridge to the holy altar to the south.

justice that govern the whole kingdom of Thorbardin. As the dwarven society
is a theocracy where the most important decisions flow from the will of the
god Reorx, this hall also functions as the dwarves' most holy temple. Giant
marble columns depicting the glory and teaching of Reorx march around the
perimeter of the hall, bestowing their wisdom on all who visit. A pair of
massive bronze doors guard the entrance to the north, while rubies set into
the ground lead towards the arched bridge to the holy altar to the south.

    The giant black iron gate to the south is made of inch-thick bars and
appears to be nigh indestructible. Dwarven runes etched into the dolomite
plaque hanging over the gate proclaim this the entrance to Daerbardin, and
a separate sign opposite the gates indicates that this is the Fifteenth

east, the Road ends abruptly at the entrance to massive mushroom warrens.

[36mThe Southern Docks[0;37m
    Built on the limestone island beneath the Life Tree at the center of
Thorbardin, these docks bustle with activity as dwarves from every clan
pass through on the way to the taverns, forges, and shops housed within. A
large winch system sits upon the rocky shore, and thick cables stretch off
across the Urkhan Sea to guide the mechanized ferries over the water. The
sign posted near the winches indicates that ferries leaving from this dock
will deposit passengers near the cities of Agharbardin and Daerbardin.

[36mThe Base of the Life Tree[0;37m
    The gigantic stalactite known as the Life Tree of the Hylar soars up
from here, widening gradually as it rises towards the shadowy ceiling far
above the Urkhan Sea. The outer surface of the stalactite is covered with
an unusual, iridescent coral which casts a warm light that illuminates the
vast cavern surrounding it. Here at its base, the magnificent stalactite
tapers until it is only as wide around as a dwarven waist where it merges
with the limestone island beneath it. A trio of vertical transport shafts
cut through the center of the Life Tree, and the screeching pulleys of the
steam-powered lifts drown out the sounds coming from the nearby docks.

stop on this level. The high ceiling and the archways leading away from
the station are unusually tall for dwarven architecture, as if this area
is designed to accommodate the needs of bigger races. Sturdy wooden boards
block movement through the archways in all directions except north.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a dwarf steps off on
this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must
have fallen off contraptions being transported to other parts of the huge
mountain kingdom. Unlike gnomish parts, these spare parts are as finely
made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

it was once a beautiful testament to dwarven stonework. Now, however, the
scratched stone floor is littered with loose gears, broken tools, random
screws and half-finished contraptions. The famed Hylar engineers must work
in the nearby buildings, perfecting the technology that the dwarves use to
defend their mountain home and keep their mighty kingdom running.

[36mLevel 10 Lift Station[0;37m
    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a dwarf steps off on
this level. The floor is littered with gears, pulleys and screws that must
have fallen off contraptions being transported to other parts of the huge
mountain kingdom. Unlike gnomish parts, these spare parts are as finely
made as all things made by dwarves. The storied workshops and libraries of
the Hylar engineers must lie beyond the massive stone archways.

[36mLevel 12 Lift Station[0;37m
    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and almost every single one stops on
this level to drop off a few gruff dwarven commoners. The area is fairly
clean except for some small piles of refuse, as if the garbage collectors
don't come by frequently enough. All of the massive stone archways leading
away from the lift station are plain and unadorned, but the archway to the
south appears to have been recently and permanently boarded up.

given the race's reputation for drinking and the infamy of their signature
beverage, most of them are actually pretty simple watering holes like this
one. Since this tavern isn't frequented very much anymore, it's started to
get dingy, but is otherwise a serviceable place to get a stiff drink.

[36mThe Blue Salamander Tavern[0;37m
    While one might think the taverns of dwarves to be fine establishments
given the race's reputation for drinking and the infamy of their signature
beverage, most of them are actually pretty simple watering holes like this
one. Since this tavern isn't frequented very much anymore, it's started to
get dingy, but is otherwise a serviceable place to get a stiff drink.

[36mA Ruined Courtyard[0;37m
    What was once a splendid courtyard lined with glamorous statues of
dwarven heroes is now a barren area guarded by ruined statues. There is a
faded glamour to this ancient courtyard, which still maintains some of its
regal air, but all of the shops are closed except the bar to the east.

[36mLevel 12 Lift Station[0;37m
    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and almost every single one stops on
this level to drop off a few gruff dwarven commoners. The area is fairly
clean except for some small piles of refuse, as if the garbage collectors
don't come by frequently enough. All of the massive stone archways leading
away from the lift station are plain and unadorned, but the archway to the
south appears to have been recently and permanently boarded up.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and occasionally a lift stops on this
level so that a well-dressed dwarf or two can step off. The station walls
are lined with platinum and gold panels, suggesting that the dwarves who
live here must be among the wealthiest in Thorbardin. Elaborate carvings
adorn the impressive doors set in the magnificent archways to the east and
south, while the door to the west has been permanently welded shut.

[36mA Gaudy Antechamber[0;37m
    A shocking amount of gold and platinum has been used in decorating
this antechamber, which has been designed to shock and awe visitors. The
ostentatious furnishings amplify the light from the two glow worms napping
on the ceiling until it's almost blinding. The grand hall of this opulent
home lies to the east, while the exit is guarded by a gilded door.

[36mAn Ostentatious Grand Hall[0;37m
    While this enormous grand hall is only slightly less gilded than the
antechamber before it, it is still more opulently decorated than most royal
palaces elsewhere in the world. The owner's taste for platinum and gold is
again on display, this time tempered with mahogany accents that make the
room less blinding to stand in. Besides the antechamber to the west, the
only other exit is a small platinum door on the north side of the hall. It
seems like the owner of this home ran out of money, since there aren't any
doors in the doorways in the gilded walls to the east and south.

this bedroom is both plain and incomplete. The walls are half-painted with
golden veneer, the dresser and chairs are made from cheap pine wood and
the floor is covered with a bedroll instead of a rug. The only furniture
that remotely exudes wealth is the golden four-post bed, but three of the
posts are unfinished. It's as if the owner of the home ran out of money.

extravagant. A cherrywood door has been set in the western wall, and the
magnificent archway to the south leads into a decadent dining hall.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and the dwarves who disembark on this
level include representatives from many different clans. The station walls
are adorned with majestic sculptures that tell the stories how all of the
dwarven clans came together to found the mighty nation of Thorbardin. Each
of the four archways is carved in the style and stone of a different clan,
named by the plaques above them: Theiwar, Daewar, Daergar and Klar.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and the dwarves who disembark on this
level include representatives from many different clans. The station walls
are adorned with majestic sculptures that tell the stories how all of the
dwarven clans came together to found the mighty nation of Thorbardin. Each
of the four archways is carved in the style and stone of a different clan,
named by the plaques above them: Theiwar, Daewar, Daergar and Klar.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and the dwarves who disembark on this
level include representatives from many different clans. The station walls
are adorned with majestic sculptures that tell the stories how all of the
dwarven clans came together to found the mighty nation of Thorbardin. Each
of the four archways is carved in the style and stone of a different clan,
named by the plaques above them: Theiwar, Daewar, Daergar and Klar.

    The sounds of hissing steam and clanking chains echo off the limestone
walls of this lift station. The lifts are constantly moving up and down on
the chains in the transport shafts, and the dwarves who disembark on this
level include representatives from many different clans. The station walls
are adorned with majestic sculptures that tell the stories how all of the
dwarven clans came together to found the mighty nation of Thorbardin. Each
of the four archways is carved in the style and stone of a different clan,
named by the plaques above them: Theiwar, Daewar, Daergar and Klar.

Short, disheveled, and kind of wretched-looking, this frumpy hylar dwarf
probably never had friends when she was growing up. She always seems to
be mumbling to herself about some fungus or another, talking about topics
that only dwarves steeped in the lore of mycology might have any interest
in. Absently fiddling with a lock of her mold-encrusted hair, she wanders
amongst the toadstools of the garden looking for rare new specimens.

    This is a small tavern but filled to the brim with rowdy customers that
are both loud and drunk. Stale ale and bowls of musty broth are served by a
couple of wenches, occasionally having to fend off a few wandering hands. A
small fireplace lies in the north wall providing little light as most of
the corners of the tavern are shrouded in darkness.

    This is a small tavern but filled to the brim with rowdy customers that
are both loud and drunk. Stale ale and bowls of musty broth are served by a
couple of wenches, occasionally having to fend off a few wandering hands. A
small fireplace lies in the north wall providing little light as most of
the corners of the tavern are shrouded in darkness.

    This is a small tavern but filled to the brim with rowdy customers that
are both loud and drunk. Stale ale and bowls of musty broth are served by a
couple of wenches, occasionally having to fend off a few wandering hands. A
small fireplace lies in the north wall providing little light as most of
the corners of the tavern are shrouded in darkness.

    This is a small tavern but filled to the brim with rowdy customers that
are both loud and drunk. Stale ale and bowls of musty broth are served by a
couple of wenches, occasionally having to fend off a few wandering hands. A
small fireplace lies in the north wall providing little light as most of
the corners of the tavern are shrouded in darkness.

    This is a small tavern but filled to the brim with rowdy customers that
are both loud and drunk. Stale ale and bowls of musty broth are served by a
couple of wenches, occasionally having to fend off a few wandering hands. A
small fireplace lies in the north wall providing little light as most of
the corners of the tavern are shrouded in darkness.

    This is a small tavern but filled to the brim with rowdy customers that
are both loud and drunk. Stale ale and bowls of musty broth are served by a
couple of wenches, occasionally having to fend off a few wandering hands. A
small fireplace lies in the north wall providing little light as most of
the corners of the tavern are shrouded in darkness.

[36mThe Muddy Waters[0;37m
    This is a small tavern but filled to the brim with rowdy customers that
are both loud and drunk. Stale ale and bowls of musty broth are served by a
couple of wenches, occasionally having to fend off a few wandering hands. A
small fireplace lies in the north wall providing little light as most of
the corners of the tavern are shrouded in darkness.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

[36mSouthern Avenue[0;37m
    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    The chapel is one of the largest and most majestic buildings in Newport.
It is built of fine oak timber and has a few rows of fine wooden pews.
Looking around you see a few statues of some of the gods of the good
pantheon. You recognize Paladine and his sons Kiri-Jolith and Habbakuk.
Placed near Paladine is a statue of Mishakal, the goddess of healing.
Looking to the east you see the lush chapel garden.

    The street gently curves as it follows the strong vallenwood wall that
marks the town's western border. A sturdy guard tower stands above you with
constant lookouts maintained at all hours of the day. To the south, a small

majestically above the other buildings in this town. The street swings north
to the west gate and curves gently to the southeast.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

[36mThe Northern Gate of Solace[0;37m
    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and

partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    The street curves out to align itself north-south here. The gates to
your west are constructed of mighty vallenwoods imported from the northern
forests. A pair of small lookouts have been contructed on each side of the
gate to provide an early warning to any attack that may arise. The road

    The chapel is one of the largest and most majestic buildings in Newport.
It is built of fine oak timber and has a few rows of fine wooden pews.
Looking around you see a few statues of some of the gods of the good

Placed near Paladine is a statue of Mishakal, the goddess of healing.
Looking to the east you see the lush chapel garden.

    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

[36mBefore a Gate[0;37m
    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Open doorways lead north and south from here, and a dark wood paneled
hallway runs straight to the east. Taking up a majority of the western wall
is a gate of light brown stone, set into a smooth archway that stands as
tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though
the safest path is anyone's guess.

this, what would be ground level in this subterranean building, by a flight
of stairs against the southern wall. Though you can't see into it very well

hallway runs straight to the east. Taking up a majority of the western wall
is a gate of light brown stone, set into a smooth archway that stands as
tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though

of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty

through the corridor as jail guards pass by. Two heavily reinforced oaken

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    Stepping onto the narrow and putrid lane that leads east to the

up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on

    An avalanche must have occurred here at some time. The snow has melted
and only the rocky pile of rubble is left. A trail leads to the west. You
notice that it would be possible to climb higher here. Also, a cliff goes

THE COUP SKILL
Format: COUP <PLAYER|MOBILE>

With a bit of patience and timing a thief can, during the chaos of battle,
find an opening to deliver a powerful blow to the head of an enemy.

After a coup, the target becomes disoriented and susceptible to an unbalance
or a backstab, (at a reduced damage multiplier), even while fighting, for a
short time. Once stabbed, the target will snap back to attention and not be
susceptible again unless re-thumped on the head.

Considering the timing and targeting involved with this maneuver, there is
only a small amount of damage associated with a coup. A thief can even
backstab a susceptible target while they are engaged in combat, at a
further reduced damage multiplier.

Details:
- Offensive skill which deals a small amount of damage and, if successful,
  allows a thief to backstab or unbalance the target, even if they are
  attacking the thief.

[36mThe Main Lift[0;37m
    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

[36mBottom of the Main Lift[0;37m
    The phenomenal shaft of the main lift reaches high into the darkness of
the mountain above. Complicated gears and pulleys seem to work together in
an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly

guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

Spell    : Cloak of Bravery
Sphere   : Protection
Usage    : cast 'cloak of bravery'
Duration : Level Based
Effect   : Surrounds the target with a powerful protective aura

This spell cloaks the group in an aura that protects them from the
ravages caused by fear in its many forms.  This spell is of little use
on those already suffering from the affects of fear, however.  Such
effects must be removed prior to this one being effectively cast upon
such targets.

Details:
- Utility area spell which provides IMMUNE_FEAR to group members.

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

torches above the sign. Many of the villagers walk about here. A group of
merchants mills around, having recently arrived from the main elevator
shaft, which lies directly to the west. To the north and south the Main Way
continues. The Deep Mine Main Shaft is the clear way back to the mountain

    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

side walls. Deep treads in the center of the road, indicate the path of the
mining carts to both the west and south. Mounted torches, light this region
from the ceiling down. The way south leads to a junction in the tunnel,
while the way west moves through the residential district.

    In this residential area of Deep Mine, some homes have been dug
directly into the side of the tunnel. Against the western wall, however, a
large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.

    While dubbed the 'Golden Lane', this slender tunnel-path hardly passes
as anything greater than an alley. And though completely extravagant, gold
is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

[36mDeep Mine Main Way[0;37m
    In this residential area of Deep Mine, some homes have been dug
directly into the side of the tunnel. Against the western wall, however, a
large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.
Torches set near the ceiling, brighten this residential area.

[36mDeep Mine Main Way[0;37m
    The wide tunnel of the Main Way continues through this much more
residential area of the village. At first glance it appears as the rest of
the main tunnel but little doors in the tunnel, reveal homes dug into the
side walls. Deep treads in the center of the road, indicate the path of the
mining carts to both the west and south. Mounted torches, light this region
from the ceiling down. The way south leads to a junction in the tunnel,
while the way west moves through the residential district.

[36mJunction One[0;37m
    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

[36mBefore a Humble Inn[0;37m
    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

    Fabulous aromas assault the senses from all sides of this compact
kitchen. Over the fire-pit a huge pig is roasting slowly, while at the
stove bread bakes to a fine golden brown. A bookshelf on the southern wall
holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a
priest of Reorx. A window set on the northern wall is open, in the
unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,
while the backdoor of the Burrow is framed near the window.

    Small rocks protruding out of the road force a high degree of caution
as you range through the subterranean caverns. Small colonies of lichen
grow on the various stalagmites found all over the area. To the north and
south the winding road through the stalagmites continues. The dim light of
a low fire seems to reach the path from the west.

    A big rock protrudes out of the ground here, forcing you to dodge
around it as you walk down the path. Huge stalagmites rising out of the
ground obstruct passage to the west and south. Instead, they lead the path
to the north and east. Some small colonies of lichen seem to have developed
a taste for the stalagmites as a home, as they have begun to grow in the
cracks.

    Dark gray walls climb to the ceiling of this massive stalagmite.
Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural
wonderland.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small

[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

[36mA Mud-filled Alcove[0;37m
    This tiny alcove is filled with the rich orange-tan mud seen throughout
the den of the armaboros. The bodyprints in this area suggest that it is an
area given mainly to the female beasts. Of course, since the females
congregate in this area, male armaboros, with breeding rights, will come
here to help propagate the species. The room the north appears a little
less muddy.

in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.

have spent their time recuperating energy. The path to the west looks a

this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the

moist air and smells that waft in from other areas of the stalagmite. This

Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to
the apex. Moisture hangs heavy in the air, accompanied by the lovely scent
of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

    Gagging, upon entry into this section of the tunnel is not unheard of.
A dreadful smell of rotten waste inundates the area from the north. Other
than the smell though, little of interest is visible in the direct
vicinity. The thin tunnel continues to the west, while the source of
flagrant odor lies immediately to the north.

[36mA Thin Tunnel[0;37m
    Unadorned with austerity, the thin tunnel serves as an alleyway in the
underground city. From the light smell of decaying food, it is evident that
the dwarves use this part of town for some waste disposal programs. The
tunnel continues to the east, while the Burrow is just visible to the
south.

    A small lantern hangs near the backdoor of the Burrow lighting up the
otherwise dim tunnel. From within the Burrow, noises continuously erupt
signifying a regularly boisterous patronage. The tunnel extending from this
point appears to be less often travelled than the large Main Way of the
city. A faint smell of decay wafts into the room from the north.

    Fabulous aromas assault the senses from all sides of this compact
kitchen. Over the fire-pit a huge pig is roasting slowly, while at the
stove bread bakes to a fine golden brown. A bookshelf on the southern wall
holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a
priest of Reorx. A window set on the northern wall is open, in the
unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,
while the backdoor of the Burrow is framed near the window.

    Fabulous aromas assault the senses from all sides of this compact
kitchen. Over the fire-pit a huge pig is roasting slowly, while at the
stove bread bakes to a fine golden brown. A bookshelf on the southern wall
holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a
priest of Reorx. A window set on the northern wall is open, in the
unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,
while the backdoor of the Burrow is framed near the window.

    Fabulous aromas assault the senses from all sides of this compact
kitchen. Over the fire-pit a huge pig is roasting slowly, while at the
stove bread bakes to a fine golden brown. A bookshelf on the southern wall
holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a
priest of Reorx. A window set on the northern wall is open, in the
unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,
while the backdoor of the Burrow is framed near the window.

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

[36mJunction One[0;37m
    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

side walls. Deep treads in the center of the road, indicate the path of the
mining carts to both the west and south. Mounted torches, light this region
from the ceiling down. The way south leads to a junction in the tunnel,

large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.

    While dubbed the 'Golden Lane', this slender tunnel-path hardly passes
as anything greater than an alley. And though completely extravagant, gold
is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.

Nearly a decade has passed since the original construction of this palace.
King Torak recently invested a heavy chunk of the dwarven treasury towards
a series of upgrades and maintenance projects, resulting in the current
glorious state of the palace. The palace itself has dimensions of a
half-thousand meters squared, and has been constructed in perfect
symmetry. Door sized windows with the curtains drawn line up and down the
dual level, white-washed walls of the palace. Statuettes that depict the
dwarven kings of old stare down at you with pride from atop the roof of the
palace. A majestic entryway greets newcomers to the south with massive
columns of granite crowned by perfect marble arches.

[36mBefore King Torak's Retreat[0;37m
    The majestic retreat of King Torak stands proudly just meters away.
Nearly a decade has passed since the original construction of this palace.
King Torak recently invested a heavy chunk of the dwarven treasury towards
a series of upgrades and maintenance projects, resulting in the current
glorious state of the palace. The palace itself has dimensions of a
half-thousand meters squared, and has been constructed in perfect
symmetry. Door sized windows with the curtains drawn line up and down the
dual level, white-washed walls of the palace. Statuettes that depict the
dwarven kings of old stare down at you with pride from atop the roof of the
palace. A majestic entryway greets newcomers to the south with massive
columns of granite crowned by perfect marble arches.

[36mEntryway[0;37m
    King Torak has been known to pass judgements based on first
appearances. Apparently Torak had this in mind when he ordered the addition
of this awing entryway to the palace. The entryway consists of a dozen
granite columns lined up on both the left and right hand sides. Columns on
opposite sides are paired together by magnificiently perfect marble arches
that were constructed without a drop of cement to hold them together. The
arches are held together solely by the massive pressure each brick exerts
on the other. Suspended on top of the arches is a domed quartz roof that
casts a bright hue down upon the lavish red carpet that has been rolled out
here. An honor guard post has been set up just south of here to monitor the
entrance of visitors. At the end of the open aired entryway stand large
golden doors leading into the palace. Above the doors a massive seal of the
dwarven kings occupies the remaining space.

    Just past the entryway the grand hall greets you and offers a path deep
into the heart of the palace. The hall has been masterfully crafted with
diagonal arches supporting a hemispherical roof. The four arches meet
every five meters as the hall extends to form four perpendicular angles.
The floor beneath you is made of smooth, flowing marble. Bright torches
illuminate the hall and a beautiful, polished suit of armour left over
from the Dwarf Gate Wars stands silently watching you. To the north a
grand stairway unfolds itself, while to the west the hall continues with
all sorts of paintings, artifacts, and glorious memorabilia of the
dwarven kings.

    A huge room at the heart of the palace extends here. It is here where
Torak gathers to hold audience with the common dwarves who seek his
jurisprudence. The House of Nobles also reunites here to hold council when
Torak summons them. At the front of the room stand a line of throne like
chairs that host the royal family. Three chairs in the middle stand at a
higher ground than the others, but even these are at different heights. The
highest, largest, and most intricate chair is that of the King. To it's
right the second highest, and largest chair belongs to the heir to the
throne. To the left standing slightly above the others is the chair of the
King's consort. A red carpet extends from the doors to the chamber to just
before the steps leading to the King's throne. To the left and right of the
carpet are rows of chairs for guests and nobles to assist the proceedings.
Torches illuminate the chamber, and a large tapestry reveals its beautiful
patterns in the bright light. The grand hall extends to the east back
towards the entryway.

    The grand hall continues here in all its historical glory. Masterful
arches providing the hall perfect symmetry continue to meet here. The
acoustics of this hall are mind boggling. The architects seem to have
designed it in such a way that sound would barely travel. It would seem
that someone, most likely the King, did not want to be disturbed by the
sounds of dwarves marching through this hall. Bright torches illuminate the
hall and draw your attention towards paintings depicting the successive
line of dwarven monarchs. The hall continues west deep into the heart of
the palace, while a ways down to the east you can see the golden doors of
the entryway.

diagonal arches supporting a hemispherical roof. The four arches meet
every five meters as the hall extends to form four perpendicular angles.
The floor beneath you is made of smooth, flowing marble. Bright torches
illuminate the hall and a beautiful, polished suit of armour left over
from the Dwarf Gate Wars stands silently watching you. To the north a
grand stairway unfolds itself, while to the west the hall continues with
all sorts of paintings, artifacts, and glorious memorabilia of the
dwarven kings.

shining its refragmented lights all across the dome. Every sound in this

    A large apartment that expands the width and length of a common dwarves
house opens up here. Windows looking out to the entryway line the southern
end of the room. The apartment has been furnished quite well. A king size
bed with drapes stands in the southeast corner. In the southwest corner a
fine mahogany desk and lavish chair look out towards the entryway of the
palace. A fine set of dwarven war drums stand just next to the doorway. A
series of sofas occupy the middle ground to entertain both guests and
advisors. A painting against the western wall depicts Torak's youngest son,
Prince Rethar.

small, but sleek black ore staircase spirals upwards from the cove. The

northern wall overlooks the beautiful rock garden of Deep Mine. The red

    In the larger of the two servant's quarters six beds lie in rows of

befitting a servant's room. Plain white linens and simple goose down

enjoy themselves in their time off. The servant's intersection lies to the

a good game of bridge with the two princes, when time permits. Finally, a

gives it its name. The royal bedroom lies to the west, while through the

[36mThe Royal Reading Room[0;37m
    The magnificent reading room has been sectioned off into three distinct
areas. One area seems to be prepared for musical practice. A large harp and
a variety of musical scrolls rest near a plush purple cushion. The next
area is dedicated to card games, apparently the Queen and her husband enjoy
a good game of bridge with the two princes, when time permits. Finally, a
lush sofa and an extensive library indicate the area of the room, which
gives it its name. The royal bedroom lies to the west, while through the
sliding windows to the north the balcony can be reached.

the only opulence of this loft for the second in-line to Torak's throne. A
simple bed, almost like the one's seen in the servants quarters is shuffled
away to the northeastern corner of the loft. The room's main point of
interest is a vast desk filled with documents dealing with relationships to
Deep Mine. A brilliant chandelier burning a blue fire has been the gift of
Lubs Ginello. Not to be outdone, Haulston Minorax has clearly given Corryr
the small golden pickaxe hanging on the eastern wall. Down a spiral
staircase to the south lies the exit from the ambassador's chambers. The
beautiful Deep Mine Rock Garden lies to the north, through a large window.

is frequented usually only by the royal family and their servants. Light
streaming from a pyromancer carving illuminates the passage. Immaculate
marble floors, and diagonal arches supporting a domed roof remain the

the chandelier vibrates and the lights sprinkle across the ceiling taking

Torak gathers to hold audience with the common dwarves who seek his
jurisprudence. The House of Nobles also reunites here to hold council when
Torak summons them. At the front of the room stand a line of throne like
chairs that host the royal family. Three chairs in the middle stand at a
higher ground than the others, but even these are at different heights. The
highest, largest, and most intricate chair is that of the King. To it's
right the second highest, and largest chair belongs to the heir to the
throne. To the left standing slightly above the others is the chair of the
King's consort. A red carpet extends from the doors to the chamber to just
before the steps leading to the King's throne. To the left and right of the
carpet are rows of chairs for guests and nobles to assist the proceedings.
Torches illuminate the chamber, and a large tapestry reveals its beautiful
patterns in the bright light. The grand hall extends to the east back

The prince is dressed in ceremonial robes, suitable for an ambassador of
his rank. His beard is quite long and red. He looks very intelligent, and
his position as an ambassador was given to him based on merit, not by
birth--a common misconception. Despite his huge intellect he is having a
hard time trying to keep both major guilds of Deep Mine content. Both
Haulston and Lubs seem to enjoy working with the prince, though the feud
between the two guild heads has unfortunately made working with them
difficult.

    King Torak has been known to pass judgements based on first
appearances. Apparently Torak had this in mind when he ordered the addition
of this awing entryway to the palace. The entryway consists of a dozen
granite columns lined up on both the left and right hand sides. Columns on
opposite sides are paired together by magnificiently perfect marble arches
that were constructed without a drop of cement to hold them together. The
arches are held together solely by the massive pressure each brick exerts
on the other. Suspended on top of the arches is a domed quartz roof that
casts a bright hue down upon the lavish red carpet that has been rolled out
here. An honor guard post has been set up just south of here to monitor the
entrance of visitors. At the end of the open aired entryway stand large
golden doors leading into the palace. Above the doors a massive seal of the
dwarven kings occupies the remaining space.

Nearly a decade has passed since the original construction of this palace.
King Torak recently invested a heavy chunk of the dwarven treasury towards
a series of upgrades and maintenance projects, resulting in the current
glorious state of the palace. The palace itself has dimensions of a
half-thousand meters squared, and has been constructed in perfect

[36mEntryway[0;37m
    King Torak has been known to pass judgements based on first
appearances. Apparently Torak had this in mind when he ordered the addition
of this awing entryway to the palace. The entryway consists of a dozen
granite columns lined up on both the left and right hand sides. Columns on
opposite sides are paired together by magnificiently perfect marble arches
that were constructed without a drop of cement to hold them together. The
arches are held together solely by the massive pressure each brick exerts
on the other. Suspended on top of the arches is a domed quartz roof that
casts a bright hue down upon the lavish red carpet that has been rolled out
here. An honor guard post has been set up just south of here to monitor the
entrance of visitors. At the end of the open aired entryway stand large
golden doors leading into the palace. Above the doors a massive seal of the
dwarven kings occupies the remaining space.

    This small, yet elegant post serves as a station for Torak's honorguard
to supervise, and log who enters and exits the palace. The posts smooth
brick walls have had images of the prestigious honorguard's role throughout
history chiselled into them. A marble table with neatly stacked log books
and official looking papers stands in the middle of the post. A few chairs
line the eastern wall, and glass windows facing out into the entryway allow
those in the room to view, and stop if necessary, newcomers to the palace.

[36mEntryway[0;37m
    King Torak has been known to pass judgements based on first
appearances. Apparently Torak had this in mind when he ordered the addition
of this awing entryway to the palace. The entryway consists of a dozen
granite columns lined up on both the left and right hand sides. Columns on
opposite sides are paired together by magnificiently perfect marble arches
that were constructed without a drop of cement to hold them together. The
arches are held together solely by the massive pressure each brick exerts
on the other. Suspended on top of the arches is a domed quartz roof that
casts a bright hue down upon the lavish red carpet that has been rolled out
here. An honor guard post has been set up just south of here to monitor the
entrance of visitors. At the end of the open aired entryway stand large
golden doors leading into the palace. Above the doors a massive seal of the
dwarven kings occupies the remaining space.

to supervise, and log who enters and exits the palace. The posts smooth
brick walls have had images of the prestigious honorguard's role throughout
history chiselled into them. A marble table with neatly stacked log books
and official looking papers stands in the middle of the post. A few chairs
line the eastern wall, and glass windows facing out into the entryway allow
those in the room to view, and stop if necessary, newcomers to the palace.

[36mEntryway[0;37m
    King Torak has been known to pass judgements based on first
appearances. Apparently Torak had this in mind when he ordered the addition
of this awing entryway to the palace. The entryway consists of a dozen
granite columns lined up on both the left and right hand sides. Columns on
opposite sides are paired together by magnificiently perfect marble arches
that were constructed without a drop of cement to hold them together. The
arches are held together solely by the massive pressure each brick exerts
on the other. Suspended on top of the arches is a domed quartz roof that
casts a bright hue down upon the lavish red carpet that has been rolled out
here. An honor guard post has been set up just south of here to monitor the
entrance of visitors. At the end of the open aired entryway stand large
golden doors leading into the palace. Above the doors a massive seal of the
dwarven kings occupies the remaining space.

    The majestic retreat of King Torak stands proudly just meters away.
Nearly a decade has passed since the original construction of this palace.
King Torak recently invested a heavy chunk of the dwarven treasury towards
a series of upgrades and maintenance projects, resulting in the current
glorious state of the palace. The palace itself has dimensions of a
half-thousand meters squared, and has been constructed in perfect
symmetry. Door sized windows with the curtains drawn line up and down the
dual level, white-washed walls of the palace. Statuettes that depict the
dwarven kings of old stare down at you with pride from atop the roof of the
palace. A majestic entryway greets newcomers to the south with massive
columns of granite crowned by perfect marble arches.

end in a cul-de-sac. The angle produced by the twist in the tunnel seems to
have caught and reflected the brightness of both the westwards and
northwards paths of the snaking tunnel; the result is a light so bright it
would almost seem that one was outside. The gems glimmer in the light and
the fortune that is of the dwarves awes even the richest of foreigners.

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

    Signs of active construction surround the area; hammers and picks
of disparate size lay besides boards of wood and piles of smooth stone
used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious
dwellings dominate the surrounding area, their size accomodated for easily
by the cavernous ceilings overhead. The sounds of banging and shouting
fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the
residents. Judging by the pace the Construction Guild works at, that time
is not far off.

[36mThrough the Construction[0;37m
    Signs of active construction surround the area; hammers and picks
of disparate size lay besides boards of wood and piles of smooth stone
used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious
dwellings dominate the surrounding area, their size accomodated for easily
by the cavernous ceilings overhead. The sounds of banging and shouting
fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the
residents. Judging by the pace the Construction Guild works at, that time
is not far off.

[36mBefore a Finished Mansion[0;37m
    The expanding Golden Lane abruptly halts at the front of an impressive
new mansion. The tunnel floor has been cleared of the vast majority of its
rubble, yet there is still the feel of construction. Expensive pieces of
furniture are continually being pushed through the beautiful doors of the
new mansion, and the banging of hammers and scraping of stone can be
readily heard in all directions. While most of the work seems to be on
surrounding structures, a few dwarves work to polish off the external and
internal parts of the mansion. A soft white light illuminates the area from
above. A solid wooden door, with a labelling of crossed tools, serves as
the entrance to a temporary toolshed, used by the construction guild. To
the south the construction continues.

Around the quartz-gravelled path lie large sections of layered, multi-hued

stalagmite spikes out of the ground. Embedded on its surface is a small
golden plaque. To the west the garden expands.

low cut, as even the shortest of dwarves, would easily tower over the
rocks. This leads to an area of heightened interest for the children of

    Quite suddenly, the Golden Lane tunnel, which lies through the gate to

Around the quartz-gravelled path lie large sections of layered, multi-hued

stalagmite spikes out of the ground. Embedded on its surface is a small
golden plaque. To the west the garden expands.

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

    While dubbed the 'Golden Lane', this slender tunnel-path hardly passes
as anything greater than an alley. And though completely extravagant, gold
is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

    In this residential area of Deep Mine, some homes have been dug

large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.

praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

carved statues of dwarven miners jut out of the solid rock of which the
guild is cut from. Emeralds, rubies, amethysts, and topazes are encrusted
within the rock, dandifying the already flamboyant display. The tunnel
expands before the guild in almost a large forum. Some miners are visiting
the variety of food stalls set up outside of the guild, taking a quick
break in their days work, while others lean against the building chatting
over new drilling techniques. The guild stands three stories tall, as noted
by the hollowed out rock holes, which serve as windows. To the east lies
the entry hall of the prosperous guild, while the path to the south takes
you away from it.

Tracks for mining carts lead all the way to the eastern edge of the room,
where there is a circle, allowing the carts to turn around, once unloading
or loading supplies and goods. A few dwarves steadily watch the incoming
and out going carts. The exit of the guild lies directly to the west, while
in the eastern direction the guild continues.

Some of the samples which come in here are still uncut, so a large part of

staircase leading toward the upper level of the guild, while to the north

    Unlike the lower levels of the building, and the other guilds in town,
the mining guild has dedicated part of their program to purely theoretical
aspects of mining. As early as seventeen, child dwarves are allowed to
begin training in the arts of mining. All this theoretical training takes
place in the mining halls. Many classrooms branch off of the halls, and
students regularly hustle around. Some old crotchety dwarves, professors,
oversee the hall with bright twinkles in their eyes. To the north the hall
continues, while against the southwestern corner of the hall is a set of
double doors, leading to the Master Miner's Office, as written on a sign.

[36mMining Hall[0;37m
    Unlike the lower levels of the building, and the other guilds in town,
the mining guild has dedicated part of their program to purely theoretical
aspects of mining. As early as seventeen, child dwarves are allowed to
begin training in the arts of mining. All this theoretical training takes
place in the mining halls. Many classrooms branch off of the halls, and
students regularly hustle around. Some old crotchety dwarves, professors,
oversee the hall with bright twinkles in their eyes. To the north the hall
continues, while against the southwestern corner of the hall is a set of
double doors, leading to the Master Miner's Office, as written on a sign.

    Young apprentice miners, some completely hairless, hang around this
area on break from the rigorous duty of intense study. From this room it is
easy to tell the vast difference between the miners and pyromancers. Where
the pyromancers shroud themselves in secrecy, the miners apparently share
any techniques openly with each other. The student lounge has a strangely
diverse crowd. Gnomes, humans, and dwarves all share the room speaking
amiably. Granted the few humans are somewhat outcast, but the fact that
they can work and learn together is a large goodness in these troubled
times. Long sofas are set up around tables where students discuss lessons,
eat, and drink. The students all seem very amiable and excited in their
work. To the east lies the northern end of the mining hall.

[36mStudent Lounge[0;37m
    Young apprentice miners, some completely hairless, hang around this
area on break from the rigorous duty of intense study. From this room it is
easy to tell the vast difference between the miners and pyromancers. Where
the pyromancers shroud themselves in secrecy, the miners apparently share
any techniques openly with each other. The student lounge has a strangely
diverse crowd. Gnomes, humans, and dwarves all share the room speaking
amiably. Granted the few humans are somewhat outcast, but the fact that
they can work and learn together is a large goodness in these troubled
times. Long sofas are set up around tables where students discuss lessons,
eat, and drink. The students all seem very amiable and excited in their
work. To the east lies the northern end of the mining hall.

    Unlike the lower levels of the building, and the other guilds in town,
the mining guild has dedicated part of their program to purely theoretical
aspects of mining. As early as seventeen, child dwarves are allowed to
begin training in the arts of mining. All this theoretical training takes
place in the mining halls. Many classrooms branch off of the halls, and
students regularly hustle around. Some old crotchety dwarves, professors,
oversee the hall with bright twinkles in their eyes. To the north the hall
continues, while against the southwestern corner of the hall is a set of
double doors, leading to the Master Miner's Office, as written on a sign.

[36mEntry Hall of the Miner's Guild[0;37m
    The entry hall of the guild is much plainer than the gaudy exterior. In
fact from the look of it, the interior of the guild in general has the more
traditional severity associated with a group of manual labor workers.
Propped against the northern wall is a small chair, perfect for dozing.
Tracks for mining carts lead all the way to the eastern edge of the room,
where there is a circle, allowing the carts to turn around, once unloading
or loading supplies and goods. A few dwarves steadily watch the incoming
and out going carts. The exit of the guild lies directly to the west, while
in the eastern direction the guild continues.

[36mOutside the Dwarven Miner's Guild[0;37m
    The facade of the Dwarven Mining Guild is quite impressive. Intricately
carved statues of dwarven miners jut out of the solid rock of which the
guild is cut from. Emeralds, rubies, amethysts, and topazes are encrusted
within the rock, dandifying the already flamboyant display. The tunnel
expands before the guild in almost a large forum. Some miners are visiting
the variety of food stalls set up outside of the guild, taking a quick
break in their days work, while others lean against the building chatting
over new drilling techniques. The guild stands three stories tall, as noted
by the hollowed out rock holes, which serve as windows. To the east lies
the entry hall of the prosperous guild, while the path to the south takes
you away from it.

spacing is still ample. Many mining carts wheel past, heading both towards
and away from the great dwarven mining guild at the end of this tunnel.

chattering excitedly. The path leads north towards the guild and west to
Junction Five.

[36mDeep Mine Main Way[0;37m
    The wide tunnel of the Main Way continues through this much more
residential area of the village. At first glance it appears as the rest of
the main tunnel but little doors in the tunnel, reveal homes dug into the
side walls. Deep treads in the center of the road, indicate the path of the
mining carts to both the west and south. Mounted torches, light this region
from the ceiling down. The way south leads to a junction in the tunnel,
while the way west moves through the residential district.

[36mDeep Mine Main Way[0;37m
    In this residential area of Deep Mine, some homes have been dug
directly into the side of the tunnel. Against the western wall, however, a
large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the

near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

    Incessant hammering of iron on anvil brings a sharp ringing to this
furnace of a smithy. While most of the work done here seems to be toward the
making of horseshoes and repairing minor dents in weapons and armor, the
master smith has been known to craft some new items from time to time.
Cooling buckets surround the anvil and the occasional hiss released from
the cooling process indicates that they are often put to good use.

    This is a small tavern but filled to the brim with rowdy customers that
are both loud and drunk. Stale ale and bowls of musty broth are served by a
couple of wenches, occasionally having to fend off a few wandering hands. A
small fireplace lies in the north wall providing little light as most of
the corners of the tavern are shrouded in darkness.
