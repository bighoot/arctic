We reserve the right to delete or force a player to change his name if we feel
that it is inappropriate. Character names should be chosen in light of the world
in which Dragonlance stories take place. Compound nouns (such as Darkshadow or
Flamesword), anachronistic character names (such as Superman or Judgedredd), and
silly names (such as Mrboffo and Iamanewbie)are inappropriate. Characters with
such names will very likely be deleted. In the event you are asked to change
names (gods are not required to ask), please remember to be polite and
courteous: Staff members are here to help maintain a pleasant gaming
environment, not make your personal experience difficult.

These are pieces of information that we suggest you research before you
begin game play.  You can read this page at the game prompt by typing 'info'.

1.  All the basic information we think you need to play the game is 
    available through the HELP command. Type HELP by itself to see a list
    of topics which can then be read with the HELP command.

2.  You must read the disclaimer by typing HELP DISCLAIMER. You should
    also read the rules by typing HELP RULES.

3.  New players should read HELP NEWBIE. Then read all the topics it points
    you to. Even old players can probably learn a few things here.

The roads are long and tiring, be prepared.  The game is designed for
experienced MUD players; it is full of subtle dangers, so keep your

game -- we have done our best to accommodate you as well.

"Life is dangerous, Caramon. Just stepping out that door is dangerous! You

cannot hide from danger. Death floats on the air, creeps through the
window, comes with the handshake of a stranger. If we stop living because
we fear death, then we have already died."

Welcome to the land of Krynn.

[36mNowhere[0;37m
    You stand in the void between the heavens above and the green sphere of
Krynn below. From here, you can see three pillars reaching up from the
depths below, holding up the universe. These three pillars are colored
black, red and white and form a triangle. As you peer closer, you notice a
fourth, almost invisible pillar in the middle of them, separate, yet still
a part of the whole. A multitude of silvery strings range out from here,
heading earthward towards various points upon Krynn. Several of the thicker
strings are so close at hand that you feel a simple thought would be
required to make contact with them.

You may choose your starting point by simply typing it or speaking the
location's name.

New players should start in:

panoramic view of the entire village of Solace. The amazing sight of houses
built on top of vallenwood trees surrounding Solace and connected by a
series of canopy walks leaves a sense of awe and wonderment. Unique images
like smoke piping from Theros' chimney and clusters of people chewing on
spiced potatoes near the Inn of the Last Home offer a taste of all the
different facets of life in Solace.

    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a neighboring
vallenwood tree.

[36mSolace Square[0;37m
    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

[36mNorthern Avenue[0;37m
    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    The avenue continues to wind north and south through the dense forest

is possible to leave the avenue and venture west here.

    The avenue stretches north and south among the huge vallenwoods. The
limbs of the trees intertwine above you, providing a protective canopy from
the harsh outside world. A very large vallenwood stands at the edge of the
road here. To the east a large clearing with a tremendous vallenwood is
accessible.

    This clearing is set off from the main road. The lush undergrowth of
the forest forms a living boundary around its edges. In the center of the
clearing is a huge vallenwood. Looking up into the vallenwood, you spy what
looks like a small shop. A stairway spirals down around the trunk, reaching
the ground right before you. Northern Avenue is visible to your west. A
small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    This magic shop is an old and dusty place. Shelves and cases line the
walls and fill the room. Scrolls, books, wands, staves, and all sorts of
magical paraphernalia is on display. The shades on the windows let in stray
rays of light which streak through the dust filled air, making slashes
across the dim room. A faint smell of incense fills the air and you hear
chimes tinkling in the distance. A set of spiral staircase carved into the
tree leads down. The center of the tree can be accessed through a door to
the west.

    This vallenwood tree rises above the surrounding trees. Thick strong
branches extend both east and west of the tree, supporting structures on
both flanks. Occasionally a Solace citizen walks in from the west,
clutching a bag close to their chest while looking around suspiciously.
From the east the infrequent explosion can be heard.
