book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the

near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring

     You stand at the south end of a mighty stone bridge.  Below, a very
large and swift flowing river roars down towards the New Sea.  The river
is quite dangerous and only the largest of ferries are capable of being
able to properly navigate it.  The bridge itself is wide and is one of
the most impressive feats of dwarven craftsmanship that you have ever

    Looking around as you cross the immense stone bridge, you gaze in awe
at a pair of huge pillars of stone. The pillars seem to be the main
foundation of the structure, keeping it a safe distance from the raging
waters below. Even from here, you can hear the roar from the river below as
it crashes into the pillars and is forced around them. The stone bridge
stretches northward, high above the river, but the southern bank is still
reassuringly nearby.

In the air you can faintly smell salt, carried by a breeze blowing from the
northeast. The road leads to the north and east from here. Southeast you can
hear the sounds of a bustling town and to the north you hear a low rumbling.

platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Open doorways lead north and south from here, and a dark wood paneled
hallway runs straight to the east. Taking up a majority of the western wall
is a gate of light brown stone, set into a smooth archway that stands as
tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though
the safest path is anyone's guess.

    A few sleeping recruits pay little attention to your being here,
fatigued from long hours of training in the lower floors. Lumpy bunks
covered in wiry grey sheets stand stacked closed together, almost rising up
to the ceiling. Small footlockers are wedged underneath the bottom bunks,
containing the recruits' only worldly possessions. The line of cots runs
east and south from here, where more recruits doze peacefully.

    A few sleeping recruits pay little attention to your being here,
fatigued from long hours of training in the lower floors. Lumpy bunks
covered in wiry grey sheets stand stacked closed together, almost rising up
to the ceiling. Small footlockers are wedged underneath the bottom bunks,
containing the recruits' only worldly possessions. The line of cots runs
east and south from here, where more recruits doze peacefully.

meet up with a curved ceiling, and lead westward through a twisting
passage, while to the east the foreboding doors of a temple to the dark
goddess lie before you. Clearly the coward's way is to flee west away from
the danger within, though those who wish to follow in the footsteps of
heroes would surely brave on to the dangers of the temple.

    The stone walls here are obscured by black curtains that hang loosely
from the ceiling. Rising up from the floor near the south wall is a
sacrificial altar made of pure silver. Two arms ending in sharp claws
branch out from it's base to hold the sacrifice, and a sharp blade
protrudes in between their grip to thrust through the victim's chest. At
the base of the altar a bowl rests in the gaping maw of a dragon's head
crafted of the same silver, full of blood from the latest human sacrifice
to the goddess Takhisis.

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly

here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

[36mThe Seedy Lane[0;37m
    A very dark and foggy lane, the smell of evil evades the once fresh air
around you. In the distance to the west you can see a faint glow of light
and hear much cackling and laughter. The occasional sound of breaking wood
echoes around the damp walls that keep the cold from the hovels in this

[36mThe Seedy Lane[0;37m
    The sounds of brawling and laughter are very prevelant on this part of
the lane, and you can see the source of the noise. Directly to the west of
you is a very dubious looking inn. A pile of broken benches lie stacked to
one side, next to the big oak door that could withstand the brute force of
ten men. You do not doubt that in such a place it would be very handy.

    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems

the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems

    A bubbling black cauldron, behind a sturdy mahogany counter, floods the
room with potent and occasionally noxious odors. Crossing over the counter,
near the ceiling hangs a long steel rack. From the rack hang a variety of
curios with alchemical importance, including bat wings, lizard tails, and a
length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring
alchemist could find some useful tools from this shop in the stronghold.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    This well-trod path through Que-teh Village allows easy access to the
few larger and more populated tents of the encampment. It also provides the
major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. There is always someone
wandering around this path, be it the occasional farmer or group of
children playing contentedly. However, the threat of the dragonarmy looms
over the village at all times, and there is an underlying air of constant

    You are standing in the middle of a dark, cozy tent. Thick, neatly
trimmed furs of numerous beasts serve as carpeting for this quaint little
room. The lighting is provided by small, rustic lanterns hung upon each of
the tent's four main support poles. The central support pole is rather
large and carved with intricate runes from top to bottom, portraying the
hunt of some great, mystical beast. A bedroll rests on the floor of the
southeast corner of the tent, surrounded by books. Stacks of books and
tanned hides with spell components laid out on them occupy the rest of the
room.

fork or a small wooden plate. At the back of the tent is a large firepit
with a variety of different types of meat roasting on its spit. Throughout

food for them wander in, fill a plate, and walk a short distance to the
village campfire to dine with their friends.

than the forest that houses Solace. Southern Avenue leads north into
