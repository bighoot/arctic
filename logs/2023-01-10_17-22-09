[35mThe Inn of Myth[0;37m
    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

length of chimera hair. Atop the rack are jars filled with strangely colored
liquids, one of which is labeled dragon tears. Certainly, an aspiring

[36mA Narrow Road[0;37m
    A narrow road leads deep into a thick forest of very tall trees and
north it leads through the plains of Abanasinia. Around you are many trees
but not as many as to the south. The road runs in the near shadows of the
Kharolis mountains which can be seen off to the west, beyond a great lake.
The mountains appear to run north for some distance before ending. The
plains spread out to the north from here for many leagues.

    This narrow, dirt road winds its way through the great forest, curving

the road continues. Large bushes block your view to the east and west.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    The bough of this vallenwood tree is wide enough to allow ten people to
walk across side by side. You notice a small temple to the east with scores
of people moving in and out, heads bowed. to the west, devout knights seek
solace and divine intervention in a shrine built into a branch. To the
south the bough climbs upward at forty-five degrees, but footholds and
handholds allow for easy progress upwards.

    The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a neighboring

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some

are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors

executioners block and west to Tavern Square, you are aware of the dark and
evil feeling that surrounds you. The tall houses and buildings are boarded
up, save for a balcony which runs past the block itself. A good viewing
point for the peasants. It is easy to understand why this lane is nicknamed
'Death Row'.

[36mThe Executioners Block[0;37m
    You leave the claustrophobic surroundings of Death Row and step out
into a small square that houses the executioners block on a wooden platform
at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

    The road leads east to the city jail, the start of the journey for many
of the prisoners on death row. It is also their last. The dank smell of
rotting flesh and unwashed bodies is not very pleasant. You force yourself
to continue.

    A two story building built from blood red brick looms to the east. Wide
stone steps, chipped and cracked from heavy traffic, lead up to the front
double doors. A large sign swinging above the frame clearly tells you this
is the Balifor City Jail. For many prisoners passage beyond those doors is
the beginning of the end. From some of the yellow stains on the steps, a
few didn't handle it well. Several guards linger around the entrance, added
guards for something out of the ordinary.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and

fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The

inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.

here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    A dark aura clouds the hallway east of here, where the black doors of a
temple radiate wickedness. The stone wall opens up in an archway to the
south, which leads into a sloppy mess hall, and to the west the hallway
twists off heading south. Light breezes whisper in through slat-like
windows in the northern wall, making the stench of rotten food from the
south more bearable.

[36mBefore a Temple of Takhisis[0;37m
    Standing before double doors carved with the two common visages of
Takhisis, you are immediately struck by a powerful evil aura. Stone walls
meet up with a curved ceiling, and lead westward through a twisting
passage, while to the east the foreboding doors of a temple to the dark
goddess lie before you. Clearly the coward's way is to flee west away from
the danger within, though those who wish to follow in the footsteps of
heroes would surely brave on to the dangers of the temple.

heading up to the base of an altar dedicated to Takhisis, which takes up
the entire southern wall of this wide room. Light tan pallets of woven hemp
line the rows of pews from east to west, upon which Takhisis's acolytes
kneel to offer her dark prayers. Leading west is an entryway into a
hallway, occupied by two black wooden doors, one bearing a carving of a
beautiful woman and the other a hideous dragon with five heads.

    The stone walls here are obscured by black curtains that hang loosely
from the ceiling. Rising up from the floor near the south wall is a
sacrificial altar made of pure silver. Two arms ending in sharp claws
branch out from it's base to hold the sacrifice, and a sharp blade
protrudes in between their grip to thrust through the victim's chest. At
the base of the altar a bowl rests in the gaping maw of a dragon's head
crafted of the same silver, full of blood from the latest human sacrifice
to the goddess Takhisis.

sacrificial altar made of pure silver. Two arms ending in sharp claws
branch out from it's base to hold the sacrifice, and a sharp blade
protrudes in between their grip to thrust through the victim's chest. At
the base of the altar a bowl rests in the gaping maw of a dragon's head

dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    This settlement is the last stop for the trade caravans before they
split up to take some of their goods to Caergoth while others take their
wares to the port city of Port o'Call on the shores of the Newsea. These
caravans would normally head toward the main road just west of here on
their way to Caergoth and Port o'Call. A small path ends in the heart of
the settlement. To the south a small sign portraying the three moons stands
beside a small door.

    The road through the plains of Solamnia runs along the outskirts of the
settlement of Harrying. The road continues north towards Vingaard and south
along the coast to Port o'Call. A smaller road leads into the heart of the
settlement to the east. The smell of lilacs and roses hangs in the air
here. As you pause to enjoy the odors, you notice the road through Harrying
is not as crowded as you would think it would be. This settlement is the
last stop for the trade caravans before they split up to take some of their
goods to Caergoth while others take their wares north of the Vingaard
River.

Port o'Call slowly make their way northwest towards Caergoth and Palanthas
where they can sell these items for a sizable profit.

scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of

    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

the Solamnic Knighthood, stands just to the side of Westgate pass. The
Knight's Spur, a much more recent addition, stretches out across the
northern exit of the pass, protecting the city of Palanthas that lies
beyond. A few snow-capped peaks of the Vingaard Mountains can be seen in

natural barriers, this valley is an excellent and safe place to farm and
raise live stocks. As you travel along this road, you see many farms along
the way. The path widens to the east, where it follows the western wall of
Palanthas.

monument to the left is of a solitary man, his face shrouded by his cloak,
leaning gently on a walking staff. A small owl is perched on his right
shoulder. The monument to the right looks to be a simple block of granite,
but you sense it is more than that. Stepping closer, you see what appear to
be shatter marks in the otherwise pristine stone. Laying atop the granite
block is what appears to be a mold for the blade and hilt of a sword. The
trees and grass here is severely overgrown, making you wonder when the last

side. And there is no sign of the path needing grooming of any kind. Oddly,

impossible to tarnish its unremarkable appearance. To the north you see

feel a sense of wariness, you cannot locate the source of your discomfort

     As you suspected earlier the cliff drops off into a small valley, but
that supposition couldn't have prepared you for what lies within that
valley. Jutting out from beneath the far wall of the valley is the edge of
a building, made from the same stone as the valley walls. You suspect that
it goes much further into the wall, but can't be sure from this distance.
Lying between you and that building is a large field, which looks as though
a war once raged upon it. There are signs of a barricade to your right, a
rock slide to the left, and various pits and traps in between. With sudden
abruptness you realize you are standing on the cliff the young druid
sacrificed his life upon in a final spell to end the Celestial War. Surely
the building hidden under the valley wall must be the Celestial Temple he

beneath your feet is a lifeless color, everything that once grew here
having been crushed into oblivion under soldiers' feet years earlier. As
you shuffle your feet to get a better look around, the dust you kick up

red crystal, at least on this side. As you run your hands along the almost
frictionless surface, you discover that the block turns to granite halfway
along each side. Gazing atop the statue, you see the figure of a large
Aurinite knight, his shield and sword resting against on the ground before
him, staring passionless at the valley wall. There looks to be a second
figure standing back-to-back with the Aurinite, but you can't tell from

of equipment, weapons, and armour covered with years of dust and decay
litter the floor. None appear to be in any condition that would make them
valuable, even as souvenirs of the war. Judging from the few tracks you can

[36mCalm in the Storm[0;37m
     Remarkably this small area of the valley appears to have been spared
the ravages the rest of the valley suffered. There is no debris from
equipment or weapons, no signs of any scuffles, and no bodies within sight.
It immediately seems strange to you that this single area was saved from
the Celestial War, but then you notice the faint marks along the ground.
Upon closer examination, they vaguely resemble the marks a broom with stiff
bristles might leave if it were used to sweep the area. It is with some
hesitation you admit to yourself that somebody deliberately cleaned this
area of the valley, though for what reason you can only guess.

[36mEdge of the Rock Slide[0;37m
     The rock slide you saw from the cliff above the valley, the one that
jutted out from the west wall, comes to an end here, allowing you easy
access to the north again. There is no sign what caused the rock slide this
far from the wall, but it feels unnatural even from this distance. Whatever
force buried the Celestial Temple beneath the valley walls probably
inadvertently caused this rock slide as well. Though you can travel to the
north, west, and south from here, the area immediately to your east has
been cut off by a large pit. Glancing down into the pit you see a
collection of pointed spears, but there are no bodies on the spears
indicating it was ever successfully used.

[36mEdge of the Rock Slide[0;37m
     The rock slide you saw from the edge of the valley ends here, but it
isn't the mass of stone that captures your attention. This area of the
battle field holds the same signs of the war that plagued the rest of the
valley. There are broken swords, rusted out piece of armour, and various
other pieces of equipment badly in need of repairs. But the war remains
seem deliberately sorted into piles of similar items. Weapons have been
sorted from armour and clothing. By the amount of dust that has collected
on the piles, you guess that whoever did this did so shortly after the war
ended and then left them here unattended.

     Taking up the expanse of land immediately to the south and obscuring
your view of the rest of the valley is the same rock slide you saw from the
edge of the valley. But something seems wrong about where you are standing.
It takes you a moment to realize what it is, and a moment longer for the
oppressive dust to settle. This area of the valley has been thoroughly
cleaned of the remains from the Celestial War. There are no signs of broken
equipment or weaponry. The ground even seems to have been well swept to
clear the excess rubble caused from the rock slide.

[36mNear the Rock Slide[0;37m
     Although the rock slide continues to the south here, your attention is
immediately drawn to one small item in the valley floor. The area has been
completely cleared of all equipment and weapons that might have been left
from the Celestial War, and the ground has been swept clean. What makes
this area truly spectacular is the single flower someone has planted in the
ground. You almost feel as though someone has begun to restore the valley
to the condition it was before the war ravaged it. As you marvel at the
single flower, you notice a dull white fence to the north and beyond it
what appears to be tombstones.

[36mAt the Valley Wall[0;37m
     The rock slide that spilled into the valley obviously started from
this place, but the disaster looks anything but natural. There are clear
signs from this angle of an explosion, apparently from multiple lightning
bolt strikes given the pattern of them. You find that your attention is
drawn away from the rock slide and to the north, though. A large gate made
of white metal stands before you. A sign hangs on the side of the gate, but
it is in a language you do not understand. Looking through the gate and
seeing what's there, you can't help but feel it reads "Cemetery."

     Taking up the expanse of land immediately to the south and obscuring
your view of the rest of the valley is the same rock slide you saw from the
edge of the valley. But something seems wrong about where you are standing.
It takes you a moment to realize what it is, and a moment longer for the
oppressive dust to settle. This area of the valley has been thoroughly
cleaned of the remains from the Celestial War. There are no signs of broken
equipment or weaponry. The ground even seems to have been well swept to

     The rock slide you saw from the edge of the valley ends here, but it
isn't the mass of stone that captures your attention. This area of the
battle field holds the same signs of the war that plagued the rest of the
valley. There are broken swords, rusted out piece of armour, and various
other pieces of equipment badly in need of repairs. But the war remains
seem deliberately sorted into piles of similar items. Weapons have been
sorted from armour and clothing. By the amount of dust that has collected
on the piles, you guess that whoever did this did so shortly after the war
ended and then left them here unattended.

     The Celestial Temple comes to a corner here, proceeding off to the
northeast and northwest and disappearing into the valley walls. The temple
looks to be symmetrical down both edges, but you can see no traces of an
entrance. There are obvious signs of the Celestial War marring the
otherwise pristine walls of the temple, but no breaks that would indicate a
way in. In a sudden rush of fear, it occurs to you that the entrance might
be locked forever underneath the rock which covers the rest of the temple.
There appears to be the outline of a door here, but you can't be sure.

    The Celestial Temple that drew you to this valley lies along the path
here, taking up most of the area to the northeast. Its surface is made from
the same stone that the valley walls are made of, telling you the Fyzians
didn't go far for construction materials. The temple comes to a corner
immediately to the west of you, but you can also step closer by going
north. There are no immediate signs of battle to the south, but you know
the Celestial War once raged there. The exit to the east is cut off my a
deep ditch that you could probably climb down into but certainly couldn't
climb back out of because of the ground's loose nature.

    The Celestial Temple takes up most of the area to the north, from
immediately to the west to directly north. Its surface, although marred by
the war between the Aurinites and Gargoyles, has obviously had limited
repairs done to it. Some areas are of a slightly lighter color, making you
think the stone there is much more recent than the majority of the temple's
dark brown. There are no signs of who took it upon themselves to repair the
temple, but you can't help but feel it was the Fyzians who originally built
it. Perhaps they felt it was time to restore the valley and its temple
after the young druid who befriended them cast his final spell.

     You can see where the valley wall meets the Celestial Temple to the
north, the temple continuing for an untold length into the wall. From this
distance it almost appears as though the valley wall came alive and tried
to consume the temple, but only succeeded in getting most of it before its
mouth was full. Blocking your path to the east is a large wall of about a
hundred spears, some topped with granite, others will crystal. The spears
have been stuck into the ground at various angles to each other, providing
a line of defense no matter which side you happen to be on. It would also
make an effective impaling point if an enemy were driven into it. As the
path continues to the north, you can see the ground get softer and darker
in color as if from moisture.

     The valley changes climate abruptly here, going from the dust covered
near desert elsewhere to a marshland. The ground beneath your feet has some
give to it from the moisture in it. There are no signs of plants or
wildlife in the area, but you sense that they are more likely to spring up
here than elsewhere in the valley. You inhale deeply, reveling in the scent
of life and moisture instead of death and decay. Since the rest of the
valley resembles more of a wasteland due to the war, you can't help feel
that someone created this marshland in an effort to restore the valley. To
the north the Celestial Temple meets the valley wall, disappearing from
your sight. To the east you see signs of a camp.

     Although this was probably a major camp during the war, possible a
headquarters for one of the two armies, it has long since been abandoned
and lost the importance it once held. There is a fire pit here filled with
logs that haven't been lit in years, if not decades. There is some doubt in
your mind that they will ever light again due to the moisture that now
hangs in the air. This area, like the ones to the west and south, is more a
marshland than the desert the valley has become. You wonder absentmindedly
if the camp was once much larger but was destroyed to make way for the
restoration project. The camp continues to the east, and there is a large
tent still erected to the north.

     There is no telling who once used this camp or for what purpose, but
you can't help feel that the camp was once much larger. From the position
of the few remaining logs and the large pit that is half filled by the
valley wall, it almost looks as though the camp once proceeded beyond the
walls of this valley. For that to be true, it would mean that the walls
either closed voluntarily due to the passage of time, or somebody cast a
spell that moved them. Either way it goes a long way in explaining why the
Celestial Temple no longer stands in the open but has been swallowed up by
the valley.

     The ground beneath your feet gives way slowly to your weigh, sinking
with a satisfying sigh. It saddens you that this marsh-like surface ends
immediately to the south, where it gives way to the dried and broken land
that covers the rest of the valley. Obviously whatever effort was put into
restoring this area hasn't yet been applied to the rest of the valley. To
the north you see what looks like the remains of a camp, but its hard to
tell with so little evidence left behind. To the east is more of the

there is the smell of something greater in the air. It seems to be

Your faith that something might be truly alive here is almost restored when
you see the indentations in the wall. The are slightly bigger than a head
with a helmet, and that is exactly what you think caused them. There are
approximately a dozen holes here, leading you to believe that either one
person had his head drilled repeatedly into the walls or this just a
convenient place to perform that task on multiple people. Either way the

you are amazed to see the first signs of life in the valley. The dried and
cracked land beneath your feet yields before grass covered ground. The dust
and death in the air almost visibly ends, giving way to moisture and life.
To the east is the valley wall, and it too takes on a lighter appearance as
your eyes wander south, the stone seeming to grow less oppressive with

     Before you stands a Celestial Gate, though this one is considerably
smaller than the ones you saw in the valley earlier. It is also carved
directly into the east wall instead of standing alone. The room is heavily
decorated with images of gargoyles and Aurinites, though none of them are
armed with weaponry. The more you study the carvings, the more it looks
like the two races are living peacefully. You suspect these were chiseled
centuries ago, well before the Celestial War began.

     Set into the west wall here is a flickering torch made from an almost
black wood. But that isn't what draws your attention, especially since the
remainder of this room is basically spartan. Hanging in the air foot above
your head are three arrows, one pointing towards each of the three exits.
The east arrow has the word "Legends" written on it. The north arrow has
the word "Land." The south arrow has the word "Portal." Obviously this is
an important crossroad in the Temple.

     The walls here are lined with an uncountable number of pots and vases,
all of them without decoration. The pots are stacked, reaching up to the
ceiling. Only a handful of the pots aren't covered, and those that are are
probably locked up tight with magic or other means. Inside the open pots
you can see old, tattered scrolls. There are no pieces of furniture or
decorations in the room, making you think this is simply a storage room.

     The walls here are lined with an uncountable number of pots and vases,
all of them without decoration. The pots are stacked, reaching up to the
ceiling. Only a handful of the pots aren't covered, and those that are are
probably locked up tight with magic or other means. Inside the open pots
you can see old, tattered scrolls. There are no pieces of furniture or
decorations in the room, making you think this is simply a storage room.

     Set into the west wall here is a flickering torch made from an almost
black wood. But that isn't what draws your attention, especially since the
remainder of this room is basically spartan. Hanging in the air foot above
your head are three arrows, one pointing towards each of the three exits.
The east arrow has the word "Legends" written on it. The north arrow has
the word "Land." The south arrow has the word "Portal." Obviously this is
an important crossroad in the Temple.

north that is causing your discomfort. Despite your best efforts, you can't

Suppressing another shiver, you look around the room. This section of the
Temple is completely nondescript, almost as if people were too scared to
spend much time here.

soon as people pass through it, the dust here has obviously been disturbed
too much to return to its natural state. This area is apparently a high
traffic area, though there is no way to tell why from here. There is a
large granite door to the east, one of only a few in the Temple.

[36mTemple of the Land[0;37m
     Drab in color and ordinary in appearance, this temple is almost
barren. The walls, floor, and ceiling are a dark brown in color with veins
of green streaming through them. The altar at the far end of the room is
made from a dirty grey stone, its surface covered with specks of black and
brown. Filling the area between you and the altar are a half dozen pews,
each made from what looks like solidified mud. The only decoration in the
room is a mosaic of a white wolf on the wall behind the altar.

     Drab in color and ordinary in appearance, this temple is almost
barren. The walls, floor, and ceiling are a dark brown in color with veins
of green streaming through them. The altar at the far end of the room is
made from a dirty grey stone, its surface covered with specks of black and
brown. Filling the area between you and the altar are a half dozen pews,
each made from what looks like solidified mud. The only decoration in the
room is a mosaic of a white wolf on the wall behind the altar.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

north and south, while Perimeter Street appears to loop to the east,
circling above the region Solace is built in. What appears to be a gate is
to the north, while you see signs of Solace to the south.

    This gate protects Solace from invaders from the north. Two huge
vallenwoods stand on either side of the road and it is between these, that
the gate is built. The forest north of the gate looks much like the forest
that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    This narrow, dirt road winds its way through the great forest, curving
around large trees and rocks. You can hear the chattering of hundreds of

marks. To the south, lies the northern gate of Solace, and to the north,
the road continues. Large bushes block your view to the east and west.

Kharolis mountains which can be seen off to the west, beyond a great lake.
The mountains appear to run north for some distance before ending. The

the huge vallenwood trees that cover the Solace Vale. Stretching out to the
north, these fields are known as Nearfields to the citizens of Solace
because of their proximity to the small town. A thick forest of pine trees
lies to the west, beyond which the Crystalmir Lake can be seen. To the east
this dirt trail merges with a wide road.
