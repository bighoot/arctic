    The Inn of the Last Home is a cozy tavern. The smells of rich food and
the sounds of merry music overflow your senses. A huge fireplace dominates
one wall and a warm glow emanates from its flames. Small tables fill the

leads down to the forest below.

    You stand before the largest vallenwood you have ever seen. It towers
up above the rest of the huge vallenwoods and appears to touch the clouds
above. When you look up into the vallenwood, you see an extravagantly
decorated tavern that has been built in and among the limbs of the tree.
The clearing stretches on towards the north and you see Northern Avenue to
the east. A spiral stairway winds down from the tavern above, reaching the
ground a short distance away. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    You are on Northern Avenue. The road twists and turns here, cutting
through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

Although there are a few fresh tracks, the arid landscape keeps this trail
from becoming overgrown with vegetation. Upon a glance, you determine that

few larger and more populated tents of the encampment. It also provides the
major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. The path continues east

around it. Activity is fierce in this part of the village.

    This well-trod path through Que-teh Village allows easy access to the
few larger and more populated tents of the encampment. It also provides the
major route of transport for the Que-teh tribesmen. A small tent has been
constructed close to the edge of the path, and can be entered to the east.
The path bends gently here, and its course can be followed to the north and
west.

    You are standing in the middle of a dark, cozy tent. Thick, neatly
trimmed furs of numerous beasts serve as carpeting for this quaint little
room. The lighting is provided by small, rustic lanterns hung upon each of
the tent's four main support poles. The central support pole is rather
large and carved with intricate runes from top to bottom, portraying the
hunt of some great, mystical beast. A bedroll rests on the floor of the
southeast corner of the tent, surrounded by books. Stacks of books and
tanned hides with spell components laid out on them occupy the rest of the
room.

[36mTent of the Que-teh Elder[0;37m
    You are standing in the middle of a dark, cozy tent. Thick, neatly
trimmed furs of numerous beasts serve as carpeting for this quaint little
room. The lighting is provided by small, rustic lanterns hung upon each of
the tent's four main support poles. The central support pole is rather
large and carved with intricate runes from top to bottom, portraying the
hunt of some great, mystical beast. A bedroll rests on the floor of the
southeast corner of the tent, surrounded by books. Stacks of books and
tanned hides with spell components laid out on them occupy the rest of the
room.

north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

    The avenue twists and turns among the huge vallenwoods. Sounds of life
are all around you. Looking up, you see the sun peeking through the dense

at ease. You see a large stone building to the east. The avenue continues
to the north and south. A small sign is posted on the stone building.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and
turns between the giant trunks and beneath the thick green canopy of
foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into
other parts of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
