[36mA Muddy Path[0;37m
    The mud here is thick, very thick. Depending on heaviness it allows
different people to sink to different levels. So for example, while a dwarf
will be up to his shins in mud, a minotaur is likely to be up to his thighs
in mud. Even though all this results in quite a bit of dirtiness, since the
mud feels warm, great comfort is felt from the sweet-smelling atmosphere.
The mud thickens to the east, and thins dramatically to the west. Small
alcoves of deeper mud are visible to the north and south.

    Mud puddles line a path, leading directly into the back of a giant
dragon's mouth. A small opening is easily visible between the skull and the
mandible. The mud here has a strange sweet smell that is surprisingly
pleasant. Deep, cloved hoofprints riddle the path here, they seem
terrifyingly bigger than the ones seen above. Most of the hoofprints seem
to be leading east, where the mud gets thicker.

    The pockmarked path through the mud puddles comes to an abrupt halt at
this section of the armaboro den. At the southern end of the path the skull
of a massive dragon blocks further progress. The skull spans two minotaurs
wide with fangs longer than a man is tall. How the armaboros gored such a
beast can be left to the imagination. An entire pack of them, though, would
truly be a scary sight. Light flickers in the hollows of the skull's
eyesockets. The dragon watching you even in death. The path through the
armaboro den continues north.

too numerous to be counted and too ominous to be ignored. A low collection
of grunting noises seems to rise up from the very floor of the room. The
path leads to the south and north, where a sickening smell seems to be
coming from.

    Dark gray walls line this area of the stalagmite, with small patches of
stark white. Some of the walls appear to have had the orange-tan mud tossed
all over them. Whether or not the tossed mud was purposefully artistic, it
definitely brings out a lovely spread of color to the interior of the
stalagmite. Cloved hoofprints appear to dodge the many puddles near the
walls, marking a seemingly navigatable path through this natural
wonderland.

Natural curves and bumps are visible everywhere, traveling all the way to

of sweet-smelling mud. A clear path has been marked by pairs of cloved
hooves scattered about. The age of the tracks is indeterminable due to the
continuous nature of the stalagmite's environment--some tracks are old,
while others are very fresh. Large water puddles line the path, with
smaller ones occasionally filling up hoofprints.

    Fabulous aromas assault the senses from all sides of this compact

stove bread bakes to a fine golden brown. A bookshelf on the southern wall
holds a variety of clerical books, probably the result of the Chef being a
priest of Reorx. A window set on the northern wall is open, in the
unsuccessful attempt to create a draft. Binar's Bar lies back to the west,

[36mBinar's Bar at the Burrow[0;37m
    A long three-sided counter is the primary object of the bars interior.
Ornately crafted wood with minor gilding along the edges comprises the
counter, but more impressively are the surrounding kegs and bottles of all
varieties of alcohols. A sign up behind the counter advertises pricing,
proclaiming proudly, 'Binar's Brew is Always On Tap: Pints-3C, Pitchers-8C'
Other unique bottles sit behind the counter. The counter itself has
different seating segments, accomodating the various sizes of customers.
The longest segment is of course lower to the ground, for the dwarven
patrons. Tables, also both large and small, have been set up with benches
so that some customers may keep more to themselves. Booths along the
western side of the room, even have their own curtains, for the most
secretive of folks. A bright fire blazes in a hearth near the northern
wall, right next to the staircase which leads down into the Burrow. All the
customers of Binar's Bar seem to be quite merry, although some dwarves are
all too quick to tighten their fists at insults. Probably the Burrow below
will be a more comfortable place to find a relaxing atmosphere.

[36mBefore a Humble Inn[0;37m
    The tunnel here comes to an abrupt halt. Directly to the north lies a
charming structure carved, as so many of the towns buildings, out of the
tunnel. This room is interestingly dim, and if not for the incredible
brightness coming from the bar, would be completely dark. Raucous laughter
and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the
Inn. On the benches outside of the inn some dwarves lie, passed out from
heavy drinking, while others seem to be gambling against the inn's side
wall. All in all, this inn looks like it could entertain citizens of
Palanthas and Solace, much less a village far below the ground. To the west
lies a junction in the tunnels of Deep Mine.

    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.

as anything greater than an alley. And though completely extravagant, gold
is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean

a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious

the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the

    A massive crest of crossed hammers regally adorns an otherwise bare
eastern wall, indicating that this room belongs to the foreman of the Deep
Mine Construction Guild. Beneath a flat stone table, metallic scraps and
chunks of stone lay scattered besides a broken board of wood, all pushed
together into a large pile in a hurried attempt to clean the floor. It is a
surprise how any thinking could get done in here, as the sounds of sawing,
shouting, and even the occasional explosion pierce the silence.

You return the slab to Groth, who briefly snorts in malcontent. 'That
rock-brained dwarf should know this slab is too thick for the floor.',
mutters the Foreman. He procures a sharp file with a thin blade, and cuts
off a layer of marble so thin, that you wonder if he even did anything at

The only real thing of note is the extremely odd contraption set into the
northern wall. Clearly a device of the Engineering Guild, it is unclear at
first glance what it actually does. The mansion can be exited to the east.

    The tunnel heads west towards a large stone mansion. The roof sparkles
magically under the light of the Pyromancer's lanterns, adding to the beauty.
Extending from all four of the wide frontal windows are stone balconies.
Low walls enclose each, preventing the residents from falling. Debris still
lies scattered about, with particular concentration on the front steps and
lower balconies of the mansion.

    Signs of active construction surround the area; hammers and picks
of disparate size lay besides boards of wood and piles of smooth stone
used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious
dwellings dominate the surrounding area, their size accomodated for easily
by the cavernous ceilings overhead. The sounds of banging and shouting
fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the
residents. Judging by the pace the Construction Guild works at, that time
is not far off.

    The expanding Golden Lane abruptly halts at the front of an impressive
new mansion. The tunnel floor has been cleared of the vast majority of its
rubble, yet there is still the feel of construction. Expensive pieces of
furniture are continually being pushed through the beautiful doors of the
new mansion, and the banging of hammers and scraping of stone can be
readily heard in all directions. While most of the work seems to be on
surrounding structures, a few dwarves work to polish off the external and
internal parts of the mansion. A soft white light illuminates the area from
above. A solid wooden door, with a labelling of crossed tools, serves as
the entrance to a temporary toolshed, used by the construction guild. To
the south the construction continues.

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

    Signs of active construction surround the area; hammers and picks
of disparate size lay besides boards of wood and piles of smooth stone
used for the various architectural projects. A block of marble sits alone,
a chisel placed on top of the striated green surface. Large, luxurious
dwellings dominate the surrounding area, their size accomodated for easily
by the cavernous ceilings overhead. The sounds of banging and shouting
fill the air, occasionally mixed in with loud explosions. This portion of
the mines, when cleared and completed, will serve as a junction for the
residents. Judging by the pace the Construction Guild works at, that time
is not far off.

Around the quartz-gravelled path lie large sections of layered, multi-hued
bedrock, complete with naturally eroded holes. To the north a large
stalagmite spikes out of the ground. Embedded on its surface is a small
golden plaque. To the west the garden expands.

changes the path's eastward leading direction northward. In the southeast
corner, a humble marble bench beckons for the weary to relax in the beauty
of the garden. The quartz laid path continues to the west, where the rock
formations begin to bridge over the path. To the northwest a distinctive
glow rises from the depths of the cavern.

Around the quartz-gravelled path lie large sections of layered, multi-hued

stalagmite spikes out of the ground. Embedded on its surface is a small
golden plaque. To the west the garden expands.

    The brightness of the white light here has been reduced substantially.
This is partly due to the lack of residence in this region of the lane, as
all the buildings are currently under construction. Furthermore, the
beautiful subterranean garden which lies to the west, requires a much
dimmer light. A large gate serves as the entrance to the subterranean
garden, and the lane is cleared up to that gate. Far to the north and
south, skilled masons build new houses for their wealthy employers.
Finally, the Main Way lies a long way to the east.

    While dubbed the 'Golden Lane', this slender tunnel-path hardly passes
as anything greater than an alley. And though completely extravagant, gold
is hardly the luxury of choice. Instead, much like the exterior of the Deep
Mine Miner's Guild, sparkling gems adorn all the columns, walls, and doors
of the dwarven mansions. A bright white light, probably a gift of the
Pyromancer's Guild, lights the entire alley from ceiling to floor, having a
rather remarkable effect on the jewel-studded structures. The Golden Lane
proceeds to the west, whereas to the east it connects with the Main Way.

    In this residential area of Deep Mine, some homes have been dug
directly into the side of the tunnel. Against the western wall, however, a
large rock formation indicates the homes of the more wealthy class of
villagers. Children of the village have a small 'courtyard' in the tunnel
here in which to play. The mining cart treads lead very distinctly to the
north and east, but there is a particularly large piling up of them to the
north. Clearly, the entrance to the rich mines of the village lies in that
direction. Back to the east the Main Way continues through the village.

and some drunken curses escape from the windows and main entrance to the

    A large tunnel bathed in a purplish glow, which tranquilly radiates
from the ceiling comprises the Inventor's Hall. In this section of the
village gnomes and dwarves with large spectacles, walk chatting rapidly.
Even though it seems that the dwarves would have attempted to kill the
gnomish desire to speak very quickly, these dwarves have more or less
reverted to gnomishness. The inventors walk about in purple robes which
drag along the ground. Junked and new contraptions lie all over the ground,
however any clear purpose to them, is lost in the extensive machinery. The
path east leads closer towards the Engineering Guild, while the path west
hits a junction of tunnels.

thick cords must do something, but it is impossible to determine what. The
metal masterpiece stands two full stories high, and seems to be quite safe.
Outside of the building, excited engineers chatter excitedly about the

    The entrance of the Engineering Guild is no less splendid than the
outer face. Contraptions are set up throughout the entry hall doing all
sorts of completely incomprehensible feats. Hopefully any gnomes involved,
aren't too far behind in their life quests. One contraption on the eastern
wall seems to actually make a good deal of sense. Each second it shoots a
ball from one side of a balancing structure to the other. Gnomes and
dwarves around the contraption seem to be periodically measuring the angle
of the balancing mechanism and shouting out a time of day. Amazing, that
the engineers could develop such a way of keeping time, with no sun as an
aid. Many other guild members check on the other contraptions around,
largely ignoring the presence of strangers to the guild. You can exit the
guild to the north or explore further to the south.

[36mHallway Through the Guild[0;37m
    A particularly long hallway, this is the only hall of the guild. Many
rooms branch off the hallway, in which investigations of engineering are
proceeding. The hallway itself is lit by bright lanterns, using what
appears to be captured lightning bolts as a source, certainly a novel
concept. Two dwarves in engineering robes catch your eye, as they rush at
each other continuously with newer breed mining carts. Impressively, after
they jump inside the carts and hit each other, neither ever seems to be
injured. A mental note should be made to avoid these two dwarves, they
appear to think the carts would not damage a person straight on. The chance
should probably not be taken. To the southeast lies the biggest room on the
hallway labeled as 'Lift Maintenance', while at the end of the hall a
stairway leads to the upper level of the guild.

Surprisingly, the tunnel east, while plenty big enough for the carts, has
no tracks leading in that direction. Villagers are plentiful in the area of
this junction, some chatting wildly with each other, while others sit on
the benches, which have been erected around the junction sign. Torches
bring an abundance of light to this underground tunnel.

    On a large sign against the western wall of the tunnel, the numeral
'One' is grandly displayed. The first junction of town is exceedingly
popular. A few drunken miners walk around in circles, stumbling about and
praising Binar's brew. Younger dwarven children run around the small well,
which lies under the sign. A group of travelers can be seen making their
way to the east, likely searching for the great inn of Deep Mine. Treads
from mining carts continue to the north and south. Flames above the large
sign bring light to this segment of the tunnel. The junction appears to be
very important as it separates the more residential area of the village,
which lies to the north, from the 'downtown' area, which lies to the south.

    Two guard posts line the side of the tunnel. They are built directly
into the rock, and serve not only as watch stations, but also as houses for
the guards who live there. Flaring torches are mounted on the sides of the
guard houses, bringing brightness to these dark tunnels below the ground.
By and large it seems as if the guards are not hampering anyone passing in
and out of the village, but then again the vast majority of passersby
appear to be dwarven. A banner has been raised across the two guard houses;
it reads 'Welcome to Deep Mine, the Deepest Village of Krynn.'

an automated fashion, clearly the work of gnomes. Huge torches on stakes
stuck into the ground light the way towards the lift shaft. Miners from the
upper mining levels, near the halls of King Torak, await their ride back
toward the surface, while some residence of Deep Mine have recently
disembarked from the trip into the mountain. To the east lies the entrance
of Deep Mine.

    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western

[36mThe Main Lift[0;37m
    This lift is huge. Nearly one hundred dwarves could stand on the lift
at once, but apparently capacity is rarely reached. The lift is also
exorbitantly clean, which is particularly surprising in light of the fact
that it is a mining lift, obviously the engineers take great pride in their
design, to have kept it sparkling. Walled in by the mountain, there is not
much to do in the lift. A large set of buttons is set against the western
and eastern walls, a good twenty minotaur lengths apart.

    The lands of Ak-Tubal and Kalin Ak-Phan stretch out to the east. They
are flat, dry, grassy plains infamous for their unbearable heat during the
summer solstice. Although the conditions can be harsh, you can see several
clumps of hardwoods providing some shade for travellers. Far east beyond
the huge plains you can barely make out the glittering waves of the Khurman
Sea. The altitude descends north of there, though to the south you can see
the jagged, towering peaks of the mighty Khalkist Mountains.

    The ominous black stones of the city walls press in close, creating a
killing zone in front of the terrifying main gates of Neraka. The gates are
forged from solid steel and adorned with stylized golden sculptures of the
Dark Queen -- as the warrior and as the seductress. The massive gates stand
guard beneath a foreboding archway, and a life-like stone sculpture of the
five-headed dragon perches protectively over the gates. The dragon's heads
seem to be moving, but that is probably just a trick of the shadows.

only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs
are unscalable. An indication of civilization comes in the form of a thin
netting that sits along the sloped cliffside to the west, preventing much
of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such
netting to the south.

    You have entered a very seedy looking shack which has hay and straw
littering the floor. Wooden stables can be seen in the back, full of horses
of various shape and size. The smell is quite revolting, this place is
obviously not cleaned too much. There is a large sign stuck to a wooden
beam.

    The narrow trading street continues to the north, where it leads to the
docks that provide the town with its revenue. The cry of seabirds is
carried on the sea breeze, the occasional flash of white in the sky
confirms this. The smells and sounds of many horses comes from the east,
where some wooden stables have been built, while to the west is a
warehouse.

    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.

at its centre. Gazing around you notice there is plenty of space for
onlookers, a small cart used to sell food and refreshments is propped up
against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the
east and west. A faint smell of blood and the uncomfortable sensation of
evil invades your soul from the passageway to the north.

source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a

here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    Thrifty blankets cover the stacked beds here, occasionally rising and
falling from the heavy breathing of a tired recruit. Cheap footlockers peek
out from underneath the bottom bunks, their flimsy metal frames barely
protecting the recruits' only belongings. The barrack continues westward,
and to the south a stone archway leads into a twisting hall.

of a mess hall. Two stone archways lead openly to the north and west, into

of a mess hall. Two stone archways lead openly to the north and west, into
the soldiers' barracks. A chilling breeze runs through the hallway,

this, what would be ground level in this subterranean building, by a flight

from here, you can feel the breeze of freshly circulated air from the room
above, a welcome change from the stagnant and stale air of these

the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the

    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    The tunnel takes an abrupt turn here, leading into darkness both south
and west. A melodic trickling sound echoes through the cavernous walls, its
source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the

[36mA Musty Cell[0;37m
    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    The corridor stretches north and south. Heavily barred cells run along
the opposite walls. Every odd interval you come across a torch stuck in the
stone, only to find it long ago burnt out. You wonder if it is purposefully
kept dark down here to further depress the prisoners. The groans and foul
curses of the rowdy prisoners fill your ears. It seems only a lucky few
will ever see the light of day again.

platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

around to the east. The Ek-Khan Mountains can be seen looking to the north,
and the hills of Khuri-Khan to the south.

    This path skirts the hills of Khuri-Khan, a large system of dry, grassy
foothills. The hills gradually become steeper to the north, while to the
south the land flattens out somewhat. The road is made of mulch and looks
relatively well travelled as there are many wagon ruts and footprints from
travelers who have come before you.

near the path where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree provides
shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection from the

uneasy feeling, as the mountains funnel to this portion of the road. The
only directions you can travel are to the west and south, as the cliffs
are unscalable. An indication of civilization comes in the form of a thin
netting that sits along the sloped cliffside to the west, preventing much
of the rock from falling on the path, however there appears to be no such
netting to the south.

    Cowering in the shadows of the black city walls, this cobbled path is
almost completely lost in shadow. The roughly hewn cobbles are covered with
filth and trash, and the path probably hasn't been cleaned in months. More
care has been taken in hewing the stones used to make the massive walls,
clearly showing where the city's priorities lie. A dreary gloom hangs over
the area, and it would be unwise to linger here longer than necessary. The
dirty cobblestone path continues to the east and west, while an ominously
narrow passage between the looming walls leads to the south from here. Off
to the north, a rocky path leads into the mighty Khalkist mountains.

squats beneath an impregnable archway, and its thick bars have been painted
black. The stone dragon perched protectively above the gate is covered with
murky scales of black tourmaline, and its wickedly green eyes almost seem
amused. The only way to escape the kill zone is to flee to the east.

    The enormous black stones of the city walls press in close, creating a
killing zone in front of the giant gate to the south. The wrought iron gate
squats beneath an impregnable archway, and its thick bars have been painted
black. The stone dragon perched protectively above the gate is covered with
murky scales of black tourmaline, and its wickedly green eyes almost seem
amused. The only way to escape the kill zone is to flee to the east.

    The ominous black stones of the city walls press in close, creating a
killing zone in front of the terrifying main gates of Neraka. The gates are
forged from solid steel and adorned with stylized golden sculptures of the
Dark Queen -- as the warrior and as the seductress. The massive gates stand
guard beneath a foreboding archway, and a life-like stone sculpture of the
five-headed dragon perches protectively over the gates. The dragon's heads
seem to be moving, but that is probably just a trick of the shadows.

[36mThe Emperor's Court[0;37m
    Opulent black and gold pennants hang from the stone walls surrounding
this ominous courtyard. A golden throne sits upon a dais at the eastern end
of the courtyard, and there is enough space for a couple hundred troops to
line up before it. The ostentatious decorations have clearly been designed
to instill visitors with a sense of awe, but everything looks a bit small,
as if the architect was told to exercise moderation and didn't know how. A
pair of cruel black gates stand at the northern end of the courtyard, while
a spacious stone passageway leads off to the south. Beyond the west end of
the courtyard lies a broad lane and the dolorous milieu of the dark city.

    The ominous black stones of the city walls press in close, creating a
killing zone in front of the terrifying main gates of Neraka. The gates are
forged from solid steel and adorned with stylized golden sculptures of the
Dark Queen -- as the warrior and as the seductress. The massive gates stand
guard beneath a foreboding archway, and a life-like stone sculpture of the
five-headed dragon perches protectively over the gates. The dragon's heads
seem to be moving, but that is probably just a trick of the shadows.

from one of the semi-active volcanoes in the region.

[36mBefore the Manor[0;37m
    The mayor's manor looms before you, the center of wealth of the town
before it was occupied. Now it serves as the base of communications for the
Dragonarmy occupation. The gate looms to the north, while cracked garden
walls are east and west of you. Since the occupation, very little seems to
have been done to maintain the manor beyond minor fortifications, and the
once proud building is looking fairly sad now. A small path leading south
leads back to the central square of the town.

     Soaring balustrades and a massive curved foyer decorated with the
finest fabrics once graced this spacious entryway. However, the advent of
the dragonarmies has led to significant damage and vandalism. The finest
fabrics which once hung above are now little more than tattered remnants.
Meanwhile the balustrades have been left broken and scattered along a
marble floor which is scarred by the claws of draconians and crack by the
weight of ponderous ogres menacing these fallen halls.

     Soaring balustrades and a massive curved foyer decorated with the
finest fabrics once graced this spacious entryway. However, the advent of
the dragonarmies has led to significant damage and vandalism. The finest
fabrics which once hung above are now little more than tattered remnants.
Meanwhile the balustrades have been left broken and scattered along a
marble floor which is scarred by the claws of draconians and crack by the
weight of ponderous ogres menacing these fallen halls.

    The mayor's manor looms before you, the center of wealth of the town
before it was occupied. Now it serves as the base of communications for the
Dragonarmy occupation. The gate looms to the north, while cracked garden
walls are east and west of you. Since the occupation, very little seems to
have been done to maintain the manor beyond minor fortifications, and the
once proud building is looking fairly sad now. A small path leading south
leads back to the central square of the town.

[36mBefore the Manor[0;37m
    The mayor's manor looms before you, the center of wealth of the town
before it was occupied. Now it serves as the base of communications for the
Dragonarmy occupation. The gate looms to the north, while cracked garden
walls are east and west of you. Since the occupation, very little seems to
have been done to maintain the manor beyond minor fortifications, and the
once proud building is looking fairly sad now. A small path leading south
leads back to the central square of the town.

    Giant cracks in the foundation of the poured concrete floor have
travelled up the walls of this forlorn manor, disappearing amid the thick
oak beams which support the floor above. The room has the distinct odour of
an overused latrine, with the strongest stench wafting from the room to the
north. A few tattered window dressings are all that is left of the
sophistication and elegance which was once the watchword of the mayor's
mansion.

     The walls of this large chamber are almost completely covered by
massive paintings of the former occupants. Mayors from over a century ago
stare nobly into the beyond. However, the effect is largely lost because
the new residents have decided to cover the austere portraits with
graffiti. Pictures of genitalia and profanity spelled out in what appears
to be feces are the hallmarks of this hall. The floor is covered with
shattered remnants of broken chamberpots, creating a godless stench.

     A broad stone staircase leads upwards into the darkness. No torches or
sconces line the walls, although the outline of a dusty and forgotten
chandelier can be barely made out in the tenebrous stretches of the
ceiling. The steps themselves have seen better days, some stained with
ominous crimson splotches, while others appear to have chipped and crumbled
from the weight of some massive occupant. Even the stone walls show signs
of disabuse, large cracks forming between the stones.

    The sound of water dripping from above can be heard as it strikes the
exposed concrete floor of this dank barracks. The floor is slick with the
runoff, and the smell suggests that the fluids might be from a leaking
bathroom above. Rusted beds support musty straw mattresses which are
covered by coarse and unyielding woollen blankets. One of the corners of
the room appears to have been repurposed as the bathroom: a collection of
chamberpots and urine stains create a stench which would make even a gully
dwarf blanche.

[36mA Dank Barracks[0;37m
    The sound of water dripping from above can be heard as it strikes the
exposed concrete floor of this dank barracks. The floor is slick with the
runoff, and the smell suggests that the fluids might be from a leaking
bathroom above. Rusted beds support musty straw mattresses which are
covered by coarse and unyielding woollen blankets. One of the corners of
the room appears to have been repurposed as the bathroom: a collection of
chamberpots and urine stains create a stench which would make even a gully
dwarf blanche.

     The heavy musk of ogre and draconian lingers in the air of this
forgotten corner of the aged mansion. The floor is scarred by the hobnailed
boots of the dragonarmy soldiers, while the walls have been stripped of all
their former adornments. Pale spots in the shape of trophies lie along one
wall, while a boarded-up door can be seen along another. Piles of discarded
blankets and urine stained uniforms lie haphazardly along the floor.

[36mA Ruined Entrance Hall[0;37m
    Giant cracks in the foundation of the poured concrete floor have
travelled up the walls of this forlorn manor, disappearing amid the thick
oak beams which support the floor above. The room has the distinct odour of
an overused latrine, with the strongest stench wafting from the room to the
north. A few tattered window dressings are all that is left of the
sophistication and elegance which was once the watchword of the mayor's
mansion.

[36mA Ruined Entrance Hall[0;37m
     The walls of this large chamber are almost completely covered by
massive paintings of the former occupants. Mayors from over a century ago
stare nobly into the beyond. However, the effect is largely lost because
the new residents have decided to cover the austere portraits with
graffiti. Pictures of genitalia and profanity spelled out in what appears
to be feces are the hallmarks of this hall. The floor is covered with
shattered remnants of broken chamberpots, creating a godless stench.

     A broad stone staircase leads upwards into the darkness. No torches or
sconces line the walls, although the outline of a dusty and forgotten
chandelier can be barely made out in the tenebrous stretches of the
ceiling. The steps themselves have seen better days, some stained with
ominous crimson splotches, while others appear to have chipped and crumbled
from the weight of some massive occupant. Even the stone walls show signs
of disabuse, large cracks forming between the stones.

    The wide stone steps which lead down into the unlit corridor below have
not been treated kindly by the passing ages. The steps are beginning to
crumble to dust, with large chunks of stone visibly missing. This makes
climbing up and down the stairs increasingly treacherous. The pounding of
draconian and ogre feet has only exacerbated the ruin. A lightless
chandelier can be seen swaying above the central nave of the staircase, its
candles long since burnt out, its copper fixtures tarnished to a sabled
lifelessness.

    Thick panels of rotting wood crowd this narrow corridor, making it
difficult to walk through without splinters reaching from the jagged,
exposed oak. The faint smell of decay rises from the floor above, mixed
with an odour reminiscent of an overfull toilet. The floor is cracked, with
large gaps providing a gaping view of the floor below, while the beams on
the ceiling is sagging from the weight of the roof above and the abuse of
the dragonarmies which now control the manor.

    The wide stone steps which lead down into the unlit corridor below have
not been treated kindly by the passing ages. The steps are beginning to
crumble to dust, with large chunks of stone visibly missing. This makes
climbing up and down the stairs increasingly treacherous. The pounding of
draconian and ogre feet has only exacerbated the ruin. A lightless
chandelier can be seen swaying above the central nave of the staircase, its
candles long since burnt out, its copper fixtures tarnished to a sabled
lifelessness.

     The heavy musk of ogre and draconian lingers in the air of this
forgotten corner of the aged mansion. The floor is scarred by the hobnailed
boots of the dragonarmy soldiers, while the walls have been stripped of all
their former adornments. Pale spots in the shape of trophies lie along one
wall, while a boarded-up door can be seen along another. Piles of discarded
blankets and urine stained uniforms lie haphazardly along the floor.

    Giant cracks in the foundation of the poured concrete floor have

oak beams which support the floor above. The room has the distinct odour of
an overused latrine, with the strongest stench wafting from the room to the

sophistication and elegance which was once the watchword of the mayor's

     The walls of this large chamber are almost completely covered by
massive paintings of the former occupants. Mayors from over a century ago
stare nobly into the beyond. However, the effect is largely lost because
the new residents have decided to cover the austere portraits with
graffiti. Pictures of genitalia and profanity spelled out in what appears
to be feces are the hallmarks of this hall. The floor is covered with
shattered remnants of broken chamberpots, creating a godless stench.

     A broad stone staircase leads upwards into the darkness. No torches or
sconces line the walls, although the outline of a dusty and forgotten
chandelier can be barely made out in the tenebrous stretches of the
ceiling. The steps themselves have seen better days, some stained with
ominous crimson splotches, while others appear to have chipped and crumbled
from the weight of some massive occupant. Even the stone walls show signs
of disabuse, large cracks forming between the stones.

    The wide stone steps which lead down into the unlit corridor below have
not been treated kindly by the passing ages. The steps are beginning to
crumble to dust, with large chunks of stone visibly missing. This makes
climbing up and down the stairs increasingly treacherous. The pounding of
draconian and ogre feet has only exacerbated the ruin. A lightless
chandelier can be seen swaying above the central nave of the staircase, its
candles long since burnt out, its copper fixtures tarnished to a sabled
lifelessness.

    Thick panels of rotting wood crowd this narrow corridor, making it
difficult to walk through without splinters reaching from the jagged,
exposed oak. The faint smell of decay rises from the floor above, mixed
with an odour reminiscent of an overfull toilet. The floor is cracked, with
large gaps providing a gaping view of the floor below, while the beams on
the ceiling is sagging from the weight of the roof above and the abuse of
the dragonarmies which now control the manor.

not been treated kindly by the passing ages. The steps are beginning to
crumble to dust, with large chunks of stone visibly missing. This makes
climbing up and down the stairs increasingly treacherous. The pounding of

     Dark beams have been laced along the ceiling of this chamber, curving
upwards until the curve disappears from sight. A narrow egress leads to an
ancient, winding staircase leading upwards into unfathomable darkness. The
faint smell of sulphur and rotting paper wanders in from the hallway to the
north, takes one look at the rusting iron of the staircase, and returns
back to the corridor. The steps along the stairs seem to be sturdy enough
to support weight, at least for the moment.

Dust, disturbed from its deep sleep, wafts in the invisible air, making
each breath difficult. The room itself smells of dried urine and rotting
paper, a curious combination that is quite unpleasant. The beams above
creak, as the very weight of the building might cause them to collapse at

    The wide stone steps which lead down into the unlit corridor below have
not been treated kindly by the passing ages. The steps are beginning to
crumble to dust, with large chunks of stone visibly missing. This makes
climbing up and down the stairs increasingly treacherous. The pounding of

candles long since burnt out, its copper fixtures tarnished to a sabled
lifelessness.

     A small sphere, floating in the air without any visible support,
provides a feeble light to this corner of the library. The books here seem
to be better maintained, bound in black leather which has become shiny from
frequent handling. The shelves themselves are much lower, as well, most
only about three feet high. The tops of the shelves are covered with an
array of dusty glassware and catgut tubing. The broken tiles and creaking
beams act as a reminder that this haven of learning once knew crowds of
eager learners, but those days have been forgotten.

     A small sphere, floating in the air without any visible support,
provides a feeble light to this corner of the library. The books here seem
to be better maintained, bound in black leather which has become shiny from
frequent handling. The shelves themselves are much lower, as well, most
only about three feet high. The tops of the shelves are covered with an
array of dusty glassware and catgut tubing. The broken tiles and creaking
beams act as a reminder that this haven of learning once knew crowds of
eager learners, but those days have been forgotten.

     A few cobwebs adorn the corners of this aging library, nestled between
oaken beams which appear to have seen better days. The shelves are pushed
up against the wall, standing almost eight feet tall, and are so covered
with dirt and grime that the books themselves are almost hidden. A few
leather-bound tomes peek out from the disarray, and broken tiles along the
floor reveal cracked concrete underneath.

exposed oak. The faint smell of decay rises from the floor above, mixed
with an odour reminiscent of an overfull toilet. The floor is cracked, with
large gaps providing a gaping view of the floor below, while the beams on
the ceiling is sagging from the weight of the roof above and the abuse of

    Barely visible from the towering stacks of books and leaning shelves,
this narrow hallway leads beyond the confines of the downtrodden library.
Dust, disturbed from its deep sleep, wafts in the invisible air, making
each breath difficult. The room itself smells of dried urine and rotting
paper, a curious combination that is quite unpleasant. The beams above
creak, as the very weight of the building might cause them to collapse at
any moment.

     While a great part of this building appears to be in a general state
of disrepair, this room offers a surprising contrast. Heavy velvet drapes
line the windows, while bolts of black silk run along the rafters. The
oaken floorboards have been covered by thick fur rugs made from bearskin,
and polished tables support several kegs full of ale and wine. The
sumptuous luxury of the room is shocking given the horrendous deprivation
found elsewhere.

streak of blood against the oaken floorboards. Tall windows have been
polished to be almost perfectly clear, providing an excellent view of the

along the northern wall, made from planks thick enough to withstand even an
ogre's abuse. A few bolts of black silk have been threaded between the
ceiling beams, rippling gently in the invisible breezes.

     A broad, red carpeted runner lines the center of the room, like a
streak of blood against the oaken floorboards. Tall windows have been
polished to be almost perfectly clear, providing an excellent view of the
slums and poverty throughout the township. A remarkably sturdy door lies
along the northern wall, made from planks thick enough to withstand even an
ogre's abuse. A few bolts of black silk have been threaded between the
ceiling beams, rippling gently in the invisible breezes.

a wisdom which has developed over time. A stern, brooding expression is
etched into his hard features, and he does not seem like the type who
understands the concepts of kindness or mercy.

[36mA Lavish Officer's Mess[0;37m
     While a great part of this building appears to be in a general state
of disrepair, this room offers a surprising contrast. Heavy velvet drapes
line the windows, while bolts of black silk run along the rafters. The
oaken floorboards have been covered by thick fur rugs made from bearskin,
and polished tables support several kegs full of ale and wine. The
sumptuous luxury of the room is shocking given the horrendous deprivation
found elsewhere.

[36mTop of the Staircase[0;37m
    The iron staircase which leads down into the darkness below has seen
better days. Flakes of rusting metal float in the air with each step, and
the individual steps bend and groan with the burden. Despite its age and
lack of maintenance the staircase appears to be sturdy and safe. The
vaulted ceiling is high enough that it is almost lost in the darkness,
while the roughshod oaken floorboards have been polished by heavy traffic.

[36mA Winding Staircase[0;37m
     Dark beams have been laced along the ceiling of this chamber, curving
upwards until the curve disappears from sight. A narrow egress leads to an
ancient, winding staircase leading upwards into unfathomable darkness. The
faint smell of sulphur and rotting paper wanders in from the hallway to the
north, takes one look at the rusting iron of the staircase, and returns
back to the corridor. The steps along the stairs seem to be sturdy enough
to support weight, at least for the moment.

Dust, disturbed from its deep sleep, wafts in the invisible air, making

    The wide stone steps which lead down into the unlit corridor below have
not been treated kindly by the passing ages. The steps are beginning to
crumble to dust, with large chunks of stone visibly missing. This makes
climbing up and down the stairs increasingly treacherous. The pounding of
draconian and ogre feet has only exacerbated the ruin. A lightless
chandelier can be seen swaying above the central nave of the staircase, its
candles long since burnt out, its copper fixtures tarnished to a sabled
lifelessness.

ominous crimson splotches, while others appear to have chipped and crumbled

of disabuse, large cracks forming between the stones.

     The walls of this large chamber are almost completely covered by

stare nobly into the beyond. However, the effect is largely lost because
the new residents have decided to cover the austere portraits with
graffiti. Pictures of genitalia and profanity spelled out in what appears
to be feces are the hallmarks of this hall. The floor is covered with
shattered remnants of broken chamberpots, creating a godless stench.

before it was occupied. Now it serves as the base of communications for the
Dragonarmy occupation. The gate looms to the north, while cracked garden

have been done to maintain the manor beyond minor fortifications, and the
once proud building is looking fairly sad now. A small path leading south

[36mMounting the Khalkist Foothills[0;37m
    The road descends here in the Khalkist foothills. To your north you can
descend into the lower foothills, or to the south you can traverse the
Khalkist foothills. The landscape around you is barren due to the arid
climate of this region.

    The road weaves its course between the barren foothills on either side
of you. The Khalkist foothills not only show little vegetation, but they
are eerie with silence as you seem to be alone in this rugged wasteland.
The road continues through the Khalkists to the north, and also climbs up
higher into the Khalkist foothills towards the south.

[36mClimbing the Khalkist Foothills[0;37m
    The road has exited the lush foothills and plains to your north, and
you can now see the landscape around you has changed to a parched, dry
terrain. You have now reached the Khalkist foothills, which seem to
transform to a more jagged and mountainous surrounding to your south. The
road extends to the south into the Khalkists, and also down into the
greener foothills.

    You continue to climb through the rising foothills which the road
passes through. The road ascends upwards towards the higher foothills, and
to the north towards the smaller foothills there, leading into a road
through the plains. From your high vantage point, you can make out the
plains in the distance to the north, past the foothills.

noticeable points of interest you can make out in the flat landscape around
you is the large stone walls of a great city off to your north, and the
rolling foothills springing up to your south. The road continues to your
north and south, into the towering foothills.

    The long road seems to go on forever as you see it continue to the
north and south from here. The plains surround you in every direction. The
city of Kalaman lies somewhere to the north, while foothills begin to take
form just off to your south. Leading off the road to the east, you also
notice a small path. A small sign has been nailed to a tree here.

    You are on a large road traveling through the vast plains that dominate
this region. The plains stretch out in all directions around you. To the
east, the plains give way to a large forest which rises far off the road,
while to the west, the plains seem to extend as far as you can see. The
road you are on leads north to the city of Kalaman, and also winds
southeast through the plains and then into some foothills.

Solamnic Knights walking about along the battlements. The huge city gates
are directly north of you and a path skirts the city to the west. There is
also a long road extending to the south through the plains.

    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

    Passing through the Solamnic Plain, the soft gurgle of the Vingaard can
barely be heard to the northwest. Looking northward along the road, a small
grove of trees can be seen, standing lonely in the flat grasslands of the
plain. A gentle breeze blows, tossing the grasses back and forth, carrying
a slightly sweet smell with it. The road extends south toward Solanthus and
the Newsea, and northward toward Vingaard.

    You have entered a small room, containing only a desk, a registration
book, and a small wooden chest with a slot carved in the top. There is a 
sign above the desk requesting all Clan members to please sign the 
registration book before heading to the bar and rooms, and to leave the 
correct amount of steel in the wooden box. You can hear laughter and bragging
from your Clanmates in the bar to the left. Clearly there has been some 
great victory requiring celebration. To the right you hear snores, most 
likely from the Clanmates who can't hold their liquor.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the
sides of the sturdy oak walls in this region of the stronghold. The flames
are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will
last forever.

    Vibrant red flames have been ignited from the small sconces lit on the

are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors
regularly make tours through the hall to keep it clean, some marks will

    The pier is a bit rickety, but it seems stable enough to walk on. Some
of the sailors from the nearby, docked ships walk down the pier and look
out over the Straits of Schallsea. You stop for a moment yourself and look
out over the clear waters of the straits. You know that far to the south
lies Solace and the lands of the elves. You strain to see that far, knowing
in your heart that it's impossible.

    The river here moves fairly slowly and smoothly, making it an ideal
place to cross. The crystal clear water gently reflects light's rays,
scattering them to and fro in beautiful sparkling patterns. Some fish can
be seen swimming in schools beneath the surface, perhaps seeking a morsel
of food. The gently gurgle of the flowing water affords a bit of
relaxation, though the water is a bit chilly and crossing quickly would be
wise.

[36mThe West Bank[0;37m
    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

    The highway runs alongside the west bank of the Vingaard River, below

    Vingaard's immense iron gates stand directly to the west, where they
present a significant obstacle to any attacking force, but currently they
have been raised high to allow passage of people and horses. High stone
walls run north and south from here, extending quite a ways before turning
beyond your vision. A stone highway leads east through the Solamnic plains
and a cobblestone avenue heads west through the gates.

ferry.

    The clear waters of the Vingaard River gently flow northward, toward
Kalaman and the Northern Courrain Ocean. The river is fairly wide though
seems a bit narrower in this area, likely the reason a ferry was set up
here. Light shimmers off the water, dancing about the irregularities in the
water's usually smooth surface. A few fish can barely be seen swimming
about.

[36mA Highway Through the Plains[0;37m
    Winding its way through the windy and fertile Plains, the highway
stretches in a general east and west direction, escaping the horizon. A
small grassy pathway branches off the highway here and leads toward the
north. Quiet and depressed refugees from the War slowly crawl across the
highway, their heads bowed down in shame and hopelessness. Endless plains
surround the highway, almost engulfing it with wheat, corn, other tall
plants and weeds. The wind brings a light chill to the air and the smell of
fire.

    The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

    A narrow path cuts in from the west and turns abruptly to the south
just before it hits a yawning chasm. Luckily, a tall ridge of black stone
prevents anyone from accidentally walking over the edge of the path and
falling to their deaths. Branches are haphazardly scattered across the
path, and a chill wind suddenly sweeps past you. Off in the distance, a
burned-out castle stands atop a cliff on the other side of the chasm.

    This rocky path hugs the bleak stone cliffs of the Dargaard Mountains,
following the contours of the mountain like a thief clinging to the shadows
and hiding from the gods. The blackened husks of dead trees lie along the

to the east leads deeper into the ominous mountain range, while the western
branch leads back down to the blasted plains of Nightlund.

the path extremely treacherous, and only a fool would stray too far from

seems to be approaching a gigantic arched bridge which spans the chasm, and
an ominous black castle sits perched upon a spur on the other side.

black stones blocks any progress to the east. However, an enormous arched
bridge of scorched stone juts out from the path, spanning the great chasm
to the north where a foreboding black castle sits perched upon a bleak spur
of rock. The only choices here are to continue across the bridge or to turn
around and go home. Somehow, the second option seems like the smarter one.

grey and nondescript, those closer to the foreboding castle on the northern

    The arched stone bridge ends at an imposing set of iron gates. For some
reason, the gates stand wide open and look like they have not been closed
in a very long time. In a way, this is actually a more ominous sign than if
the gates had been firmly shut since whatever inhabits this castle must not
be concerned with an enemy attack. The name of this ruined castle has been
carved into the scorched stone walls surrounding the gates: Dargaard Keep.

still seem capable of withstanding almost any assault. Most of the stern

stand strong. Most of the courtyard stones near here have fallen into the
yawning chasm below, but for now, this area seems to be fairly stable.

    Here in shadows cast by the blackened keep walls, the the air seems to
be unusually cold. The scorched stone appears to have melted some, but they
still seem capable of withstanding almost any assault. Most of the stern
crenellations atop the battlements have broken off, but a few of them still
stand strong. Most of the courtyard stones near here have fallen into the
yawning chasm below, but for now, this area seems to be fairly stable.

    It is quite claustrophobic in here, beneath the scorched stone archway
of the ancient gatehouse. The scratched and bloody stones are designed to
force enemy soldiers to gather closer together so that they can be killed
more efficiently. A door in the eastern wall looks like it leads to a small
guard house, while the gate to the west leads into some ruined stables. The
heavy iron doors to the ancient keep loom to the north, relatively unharmed
despite the intensity of the fires that consumed the castle long ago.

of the burnt-out keep would normally rest here, but since the undead have
no need to sleep, the bunks have lain unused for hundreds of years. A round

    It is quite claustrophobic in here, beneath the scorched stone archway
of the ancient gatehouse. The scratched and bloody stones are designed to
force enemy soldiers to gather closer together so that they can be killed
more efficiently. A door in the eastern wall looks like it leads to a small
guard house, while the gate to the west leads into some ruined stables. The
heavy iron doors to the ancient keep loom to the north, relatively unharmed

    Carved out of the keep's solid stone walls, these burnt-out stables are
not terribly roomy. There are only two stalls, and they must have been used
to keep the horses of messengers readily available. It is unclear where the
castle knights' horses would be stabled. While most stables usually smell
of fresh dung, the undead mounts used by the keep's occupants leave no such
waste behind. A small iron gate leads back out of the ruined stables.

[36mThe Great Doors of Dargaard Keep[0;37m
    It is quite claustrophobic in here, beneath the scorched stone archway
of the ancient gatehouse. The scratched and bloody stones are designed to
force enemy soldiers to gather closer together so that they can be killed
more efficiently. A door in the eastern wall looks like it leads to a small
guard house, while the gate to the west leads into some ruined stables. The
heavy iron doors to the ancient keep loom to the north, relatively unharmed
despite the intensity of the fires that consumed the castle long ago.

    The stale air of the magnificent entry hall of Dargaard Keep makes it
difficult to breathe here. Massive columns of blackened stone stand on both
sides of the scorched purple rug that leads from the giant iron doors at
the southern end of the hall towards the back of the ancient keep. The vast
ceiling swoops up towards the terrifying shadows above the once-magnificent
entrance hall, creating a vast emptiness that seems to go on forever.

[36mThe Great Hall of Dargaard Keep[0;37m
    Here in the southeast corner of Dargaard Keep, a series of burnt velvet
couches sits against the crumbling walls. This must be where courtiers used
to lounge while waiting for an audience with the lord, and some tarnished
silver goblets lie on the ground where they were dropped as the attendants
tried to flee the fire that consumed the ancient keep. The enormous ceiling
swoops up high overhead, creating an ominous and oppressive atmosphere.

[36mThe Grand Entrance to Dargaard Keep[0;37m
    The stale air of the magnificent entry hall of Dargaard Keep makes it
difficult to breathe here. Massive columns of blackened stone stand on both
sides of the scorched purple rug that leads from the giant iron doors at
the southern end of the hall towards the back of the ancient keep. The vast
ceiling swoops up towards the terrifying shadows above the once-magnificent
entrance hall, creating a vast emptiness that seems to go on forever.

[36mThe Great Hall of Dargaard Keep[0;37m
    Here in the southwest corner of Dargaard Keep, a row of scorched marble
busts runs along the blackened stone walls. All of the figures depicted by
the ancient busts are similar in appearance, so they must be from the same
bloodline. Despite having endured the fire that consumed the haunted keep,
all of the ancient busts are in relatively good shape. The enormous ceiling
swoops up high overhead, creating an ominous and oppressive atmosphere.

the ancient keep. The landing continues to the east, while a wide walkway

[36mBefore Giant Rosewood Doors[0;37m
    The tattered remains of a black velvet carpet covers this broad stone
landing. A damaged railing of finely carved marble prevents foolish people
from accidentally stumbling over the edge of the landing. A pair of giant
rosewood doors are set into the scorched stone wall, flanked by empty iron

stone landing. A tattered black velvet carpet covers parts of the landing,
but it does next to nothing to dispel the unnatural chill that permeates
the ancient keep. The landing continues to the west, while a wide walkway
of charred stone leads to the south. A series of arrow slits perforate the
outer wall, and a narrow passage lies beyond the archway to the north.

sides of the scorched purple rug that leads from the giant iron doors at
the southern end of the hall towards the back of the ancient keep. The vast
ceiling swoops up towards the terrifying shadows above the once-magnificent

    It is quite claustrophobic in here, beneath the scorched stone archway
of the ancient gatehouse. The scratched and bloody stones are designed to
force enemy soldiers to gather closer together so that they can be killed
more efficiently. A door in the eastern wall looks like it leads to a small
guard house, while the gate to the west leads into some ruined stables. The
heavy iron doors to the ancient keep loom to the north, relatively unharmed
despite the intensity of the fires that consumed the castle long ago.

creating an ideal place for slaughter. The maimed corpses and severed limbs
of recently slain knights lie scattered around the courtyard, but no crows
have dared to fly close enough to feast upon the rotting chunks of flesh.

[36mThe Grand Entrance to Dargaard Keep[0;37m
    The stale air of the magnificent entry hall of Dargaard Keep makes it
difficult to breathe here. Massive columns of blackened stone stand on both
sides of the scorched purple rug that leads from the giant iron doors at
the southern end of the hall towards the back of the ancient keep. The vast
ceiling swoops up towards the terrifying shadows above the once-magnificent
entrance hall, creating a vast emptiness that seems to go on forever.

    Here in the southeast corner of Dargaard Keep, a series of burnt velvet
couches sits against the crumbling walls. This must be where courtiers used
to lounge while waiting for an audience with the lord, and some tarnished
silver goblets lie on the ground where they were dropped as the attendants
tried to flee the fire that consumed the ancient keep. The enormous ceiling
swoops up high overhead, creating an ominous and oppressive atmosphere.

    The scorched stone walls press in close around this narrow passageway,
though there is still enough room for three people to stand abreast. A row
of empty iron sconces line the western wall, opposite a curving stairway
that leads up into the darkness. The heavy wooden door to the north stands
strong despite having been through a terrible fire, and the simple archway
to the south leads back to the main hall of the ruined stone keep.

though there is still enough room for three people to stand abreast. A row
of empty iron sconces line the western wall, opposite a curving stairway
that leads up into the darkness. The heavy wooden door to the north stands
strong despite having been through a terrible fire, and the simple archway
to the south leads back to the main hall of the ruined stone keep.

[36mA Scorched Barracks Room[0;37m
    This large chamber is filled with bunk beds arranged in a six-by-six
grid pattern. Some of the wooden bunks have fallen apart, but most of them
still look strong enough to support a grown man. The chests that were once
used to store personal belongings have all been smashed open and looted. A
heavy oaken door at the north end of the chamber leads to a separate room,
while the opposing door at the south end has been smashed by the collapse
of the passage behind it. A short hallway leads off to the east.

[36mA Short Hallway[0;37m
    Flanked by bleak walls of scorched black stone, this short hallway runs
east to west between two barracks rooms where the defenders of the ancient
keep used to be housed. A row of empty iron sconces line the southern wall,
opposite the statue of a gallant knight carved out of the northern one. The
statue appears to have survived the fire that consumed the keep with little
damage, and the knight it depicts is looking upwards as if in prayer.

[36mA Hidden Chamber[0;37m
    Hidden above the barracks of the keep, this small chamber is simple and
unadorned. No living being has been up here in centuries, and the staleness
of the air makes it almost impossible to breathe. Some simple chairs stand
in clusters around the edges of the chamber, and a huge block of stone sits
next to the cluster nearest the northern wall. A slender lever rises out of
the block, and a curved section of floor beneath it has moved aside.

[36mA Humble Sanctuary[0;37m
    A thin layer of grey soot clings to the walls at the north end of this
humble sanctuary, but the rest of the stones appear to be relatively devoid
of any scorch marks. It seems as if some divine power protected this small
chamber from the worst of the fire that destroyed the rest of the keep. The
altar standing at the south end of the room resembles a valiant knight, and
he looks benevolently at the marble benches which have been knocked over.

[36mA Hidden Chamber[0;37m
    Hidden above the barracks of the keep, this small chamber is simple and
unadorned. No living being has been up here in centuries, and the staleness
of the air makes it almost impossible to breathe. Some simple chairs stand

next to the cluster nearest the northern wall. A slender lever rises out of
the block, and a curved section of floor beneath it has moved aside.

[36mA Short Hallway[0;37m
    Flanked by bleak walls of scorched black stone, this short hallway runs
east to west between two barracks rooms where the defenders of the ancient
keep used to be housed. A row of empty iron sconces line the southern wall,
opposite the statue of a gallant knight carved out of the northern one. The
statue appears to have survived the fire that consumed the keep with little
damage, and a cramped set of stairs spiral around behind the knight.

[36mA Scorched Barracks Room[0;37m
    This large chamber is filled with bunk beds arranged in a six-by-six
grid pattern. Some of the wooden bunks have fallen apart, but most of them
still look strong enough to support a grown man. The chests that were once
used to store personal belongings have all been smashed open and looted. A
heavy oaken door once stood at the north end of the chamber, but the room
beyond has collapsed upon itself. The door at the south end of the chamber
leads back to the main keep, while a hallway leads off to the west.

though there is still enough room for three people to stand abreast. A row
of empty iron sconces line the western wall, opposite a curving stairway
that leads up into the darkness. The heavy wooden door to the north stands
strong despite having been through a terrible fire, and the simple archway
to the south leads back to the main hall of the ruined stone keep.

    This ominous chamber rests at the base of the massive central tower of
Dargaard Keep. A huge spiral staircase begins at the south end of the dark
chamber, twisting to the right as it rises up through the darkness of the
tower. An elaborate tapestry hangs upon the stone wall at the north end of
the chamber, flapping loudly every time an icy cold wind blows down from
above. The sturdy oaken door to the east is still intact, but the one that
used to stand to the west is buried under a giant mountain of rubble.

[36mThe Spiraling Tower Staircase[0;37m
    This narrow, spiraling staircase seems to go on forever as it cuts its
way through the huge central tower of Dargaard Keep. Always turning to the
right as it rises upwards, the curve of the staircase makes it much easier
for defenders to fend off any attackers trying to fight their way up the
tower. Occasionally, a gust of cold blows down from above, creating a thin
layer of frost on the charred stone steps. The spiraling staircase passes
landings to the west and north which lead off into separate chambers.

[36mA Dark Stone Chamber[0;37m
    This spartanly appointed chamber is bound by bleak walls of scorched
stone. The only pieces of furniture are a simple bed, a tall wardrobe, and
a hard wooden chair. The charred remains of an uncomfortable pallet lie in
the corner. Whoever once inhabited this dark chamber lived a pious life,
but that all came to an end when the ancient keep was consumed by fire. No
one living has been here in ages, and everything is covered with dust.

[36mThe Spiraling Tower Staircase[0;37m
    This narrow, spiraling staircase seems to go on forever as it cuts its
way through the huge central tower of Dargaard Keep. Always turning to the
right as it rises upwards, the curve of the staircase makes it much easier
for defenders to fend off any attackers trying to fight their way up the
tower. Occasionally, a gust of cold blows down from above, creating a thin
layer of frost on the charred stone steps. The spiraling staircase passes
landings to the west and north which lead off into separate chambers.

    This ominous chamber rests at the base of the massive central tower of
Dargaard Keep. A huge spiral staircase begins at the south end of the dark
chamber, twisting to the right as it rises up through the darkness of the
tower. An elaborate tapestry hangs upon the stone wall at the north end of
the chamber, flapping loudly every time an icy cold wind blows down from
above. The sturdy oaken door to the east is still intact, but the one that
used to stand to the west is buried under a giant mountain of rubble.

    The dark staircase rising up from below comes to an end at this broad
stone landing. A tattered black velvet carpet covers parts of the landing,
but it does next to nothing to dispel the unnatural chill that permeates
the ancient keep. The landing continues to the west, while a wide walkway
of charred stone leads to the south. A series of arrow slits perforate the
outer wall, and a narrow passage lies beyond the archway to the north.

massive throne from which the lord renders judgment. Ruined tapestries of
black velvet hang upon the wall behind the round dais the foreboding throne
sits upon. A scorched rug of crushed purple velvet leads in from the south
and climbs the dais steps to the foot of the enormous black throne. A broad
swatch of black cloth embroidered with roses lies draped across the seat.

[36mThe Bottom of the Eastern Staircase[0;37m
    An ominous staircase begins at the southern end of this area, its broad
steps slowly ascending along the curve of the scorched stone wall. A black
marble railing keeps people from falling off the staircase, and most of the
bulky stone figurines standing on it are still intact. As the once-majestic
staircase rises up, its wide steps slowly fade into the darkness above.

[36mThe Armoury of Dargaard Keep[0;37m
    This cramped stone room once housed the weapons and armour used by the
defenders of Dargaard Keep, and some of the armaments still lean up against
the walls. A burning furnace stands near the back of the armoury, and the
large anvil next to it has seen recent use. The rank smell of ancient death
permeates the room, and the air feels unnaturally dense in here. The sturdy
iron door on the south end of the room appears to be the only exit.

    This cramped stone room once housed the weapons and armour used by the
defenders of Dargaard Keep, and some of the armaments still lean up against
the walls. A burning furnace stands near the back of the armoury, and the
large anvil next to it has seen recent use. The rank smell of ancient death
permeates the room, and the air feels unnaturally dense in here. The sturdy

[36mThe Bottom of the Eastern Staircase[0;37m
    An ominous staircase begins at the southern end of this area, its broad
steps slowly ascending along the curve of the scorched stone wall. A black
marble railing keeps people from falling off the staircase, and most of the

[36mThe Spiraling Tower Staircase[0;37m
    This narrow, spiraling staircase seems to go on forever as it cuts its
way through the huge central tower of Dargaard Keep. Always turning to the
right as it rises upwards, the curve of the staircase makes it much easier
for defenders to fend off any attackers trying to fight their way up the
tower. Occasionally, a gust of cold blows down from above, creating a thin
layer of frost on the charred stone steps. The spiraling staircase passes
landings to the east and south which lead off into separate chambers.

[36mThe Spiraling Tower Staircase[0;37m
    This narrow, spiraling staircase seems to go on forever as it cuts its
way through the huge central tower of Dargaard Keep. Always turning to the
right as it rises upwards, the curve of the staircase makes it much easier
for defenders to fend off any attackers trying to fight their way up the
tower. Occasionally, a gust of cold blows down from above, creating a thin
layer of frost on the charred stone steps. The spiraling staircase passes
landings to the south and west which lead off into separate chambers.

off and skewered the singed mattress. The heavy golden vases and statuettes
arrayed around the dark chamber have been knocked over and smashed. No one

    The heavy tapestries hanging from the blackened stone walls were once
quite beautiful, but the terrible fire that destroyed the ancient keep has
**OBLITERATE**d whatever imagery they used to depict. The scorched canopy bed
against the wall was once quite sumptuous, but the upper beams have broken
off and skewered the singed mattress. The heavy golden vases and statuettes
arrayed around the dark chamber have been knocked over and smashed. No one
living has been here in ages, and everything is covered with dust.

    A small, twisted iron chandelier hangs from the ceiling, and its black
candles sputter weakly as they cast eerie yellow light around this ruined
antechamber. Uneven stress fractures crawl up the blackened walls, and the
supports beneath the antechamber must have destroyed since the stone floor
is missing. In place of the floor, there is a dangerous-looking hole that
leads down into an ominous darkness that seems to be go on forever.

[36mThe Spiraling Tower Staircase[0;37m
    This narrow, spiraling staircase seems to go on forever as it cuts its
way through the huge central tower of Dargaard Keep. Always turning to the
right as it rises upwards, the curve of the staircase makes it much easier
for defenders to fend off any attackers trying to fight their way up the
tower. Occasionally, a gust of cold blows down from above, creating a thin
layer of frost on the charred stone steps. The spiraling staircase passes
landings to the east and south which lead off into separate chambers.

[36mThe Base of the Tower Staircase[0;37m
    This ominous chamber rests at the base of the massive central tower of
Dargaard Keep. A huge spiral staircase begins at the south end of the dark
chamber, twisting to the right as it rises up through the darkness of the
tower. An elaborate tapestry hangs upon the stone wall at the north end of
the chamber, flapping loudly every time an icy cold wind blows down from
above. The sturdy oaken door to the east is still intact, but the one that
used to stand to the west is buried under a giant mountain of rubble.

    This narrow, spiraling staircase seems to go on forever as it cuts its
way through the huge central tower of Dargaard Keep. Always turning to the
right as it rises upwards, the curve of the staircase makes it much easier
for defenders to fend off any attackers trying to fight their way up the
tower. Occasionally, a gust of cold blows down from above, creating a thin
layer of frost on the charred stone steps. The spiraling staircase passes
landings to the west and north which lead off into separate chambers.

off and skewered the singed mattress. The heavy golden vases and statuettes
arrayed around the dark chamber have been knocked over and smashed. No one

[36mThe Spiraling Tower Staircase[0;37m
    This narrow, spiraling staircase seems to go on forever as it cuts its
way through the huge central tower of Dargaard Keep. Always turning to the
right as it rises upwards, the curve of the staircase makes it much easier
for defenders to fend off any attackers trying to fight their way up the
tower. Occasionally, a gust of cold blows down from above, creating a thin
layer of frost on the charred stone steps. The spiraling staircase passes
landings to the south and west which lead off into separate chambers.

chamber, twisting to the right as it rises up through the darkness of the
tower. An elaborate tapestry hangs upon the stone wall at the north end of
the chamber, flapping loudly every time an icy cold wind blows down from
above. The sturdy oaken door to the east is still intact, but the one that
used to stand to the west is buried under a giant mountain of rubble.

    This spartanly appointed chamber is bound by bleak walls of scorched
stone. The only pieces of furniture are a simple bed, a tall wardrobe, and
a hard wooden chair. The charred remains of an uncomfortable pallet lie in
the corner. Whoever once inhabited this dark chamber lived a pious life,
but that all came to an end when the ancient keep was consumed by fire. No
one living has been here in ages, and everything is covered with dust.

[36mThe Spiraling Tower Staircase[0;37m
    This narrow, spiraling staircase seems to go on forever as it cuts its
way through the huge central tower of Dargaard Keep. Always turning to the
right as it rises upwards, the curve of the staircase makes it much easier
for defenders to fend off any attackers trying to fight their way up the
tower. Occasionally, a gust of cold blows down from above, creating a thin
layer of frost on the charred stone steps. The spiraling staircase passes
landings to the west and north which lead off into separate chambers.

[36mThe Spiraling Tower Staircase[0;37m
    This narrow, spiraling staircase seems to go on forever as it cuts its
way through the huge central tower of Dargaard Keep. Always turning to the
right as it rises upwards, the curve of the staircase makes it much easier
for defenders to fend off any attackers trying to fight their way up the
tower. Occasionally, a gust of cold blows down from above, creating a thin
layer of frost on the charred stone steps. The spiraling staircase passes
landings to the north and east which lead off into separate chambers.

[36mThe Spiraling Tower Staircase[0;37m
    This narrow, spiraling staircase seems to go on forever as it cuts its
way through the huge central tower of Dargaard Keep. Always turning to the
right as it rises upwards, the curve of the staircase makes it much easier
for defenders to fend off any attackers trying to fight their way up the
tower. Occasionally, a gust of cold blows down from above, creating a thin
layer of frost on the charred stone steps. The spiraling staircase passes
landings to the north and east which lead off into separate chambers.

[36mThe Spiraling Tower Staircase[0;37m
    This narrow, spiraling staircase seems to go on forever as it cuts its
way through the huge central tower of Dargaard Keep. Always turning to the
right as it rises upwards, the curve of the staircase makes it much easier
for defenders to fend off any attackers trying to fight their way up the
tower. Occasionally, a gust of cold blows down from above, creating a thin
layer of frost on the charred stone steps. The spiraling staircase passes
landings to the east and south which lead off into separate chambers.

[36mA Dimly Lit Antechamber[0;37m
    A small, twisted iron chandelier hangs from the ceiling, and its black
candles sputter weakly as they cast eerie yellow light around this spacious
antechamber. The charred remnants of some broken wooden benches sit against
the northern wall, facing the ruined door to the south. The tattered purple
rug covering the floor has been completely shredded, exposing the blackened
stones underneath. A cold draft blows in from the archway to the west.

[36mA Decrepit Stone Chamber[0;37m
    The heavy tapestries hanging from the blackened stone walls were once
quite beautiful, but the terrible fire that destroyed the ancient keep has
**OBLITERATE**d whatever imagery they used to depict. The scorched canopy bed
against the wall was once quite sumptuous, but the upper beams have broken
off and skewered the singed mattress. The heavy golden vases and statuettes
arrayed around the dark chamber have been knocked over and smashed. No one
living has been here in ages, and everything is covered with dust.

    This narrow, spiraling staircase seems to go on forever as it cuts its
way through the huge central tower of Dargaard Keep. Always turning to the
right as it rises upwards, the curve of the staircase makes it much easier
for defenders to fend off any attackers trying to fight their way up the
tower. Occasionally, a gust of cold blows down from above, creating a thin
layer of frost on the charred stone steps. The spiraling staircase passes
landings to the east and south which lead off into separate chambers.

[36mA Dimly Lit Antechamber[0;37m
    A small, twisted iron chandelier hangs from the ceiling, and its black
candles sputter weakly as they cast eerie yellow light around this spacious
antechamber. The charred remnants of some broken wooden benches sit against
the southern wall, facing the ruined door to the north. The tattered purple
rug covering the floor has been completely shredded, exposing the blackened
stones underneath. A cold draft blows in from the archway to the east.

[36mA Tidy Stone Chamber[0;37m
    The heavy tapestries hanging from the blackened stone walls were once
quite beautiful, but the terrible fire that destroyed the ancient keep has
**OBLITERATE**d whatever imagery they used to depict. The scorched canopy bed
against the wall was once quite sumptuous, but its purple sheets are singed
now. Heavy golden vases and statuettes stand in one corner of the chamber
next to a splendid wardrobe of charred rosewood. Even though no one living
has been here in centuries, there isn't a speck of dust to be found.

    Terrible scorch marks cover the stone floor of this large square-shaped
balcony. The top of the ominous main tower looms overhead like the wilting
bulb of a black stone (DR m/b *19) rose. Far below this precarious perch, the Dargaard
Mountains press in close around the burnt-out keep. The scorched balcony is
in remarkably good condition and has been kept clear of debris. There is a
frosted glass window set into the blackened stone wall to the west.

[36mA Decrepit Stone Chamber[0;37m
    The heavy tapestries hanging from the blackened stone walls were once
quite beautiful, but the terrible fire that destroyed the ancient keep has
**OBLITERATE**d whatever imagery they used to depict. The scorched canopy bed
against the wall was once quite sumptuous, but the upper beams have broken
off and skewered the singed mattress. The heavy golden vases and statuettes
arrayed around the dark chamber have been knocked over and smashed. No one
living has been here in ages, and everything is covered with dust.

    This narrow, spiraling staircase seems to go on forever as it cuts its
way through the huge central tower of Dargaard Keep. Always turning to the
right as it rises upwards, the curve of the staircase makes it much easier
for defenders to fend off any attackers trying to fight their way up the
tower. Occasionally, a gust of cold blows down from above, creating a thin
layer of frost on the charred stone steps. The spiraling staircase passes
landings to the south and west which lead off into separate chambers.

[36mA Curving Stairway[0;37m
    This broad stairway of scorched stone ascends from the narrow passage
below, curving along the northern wall from east to west. A slender black
marble railing runs along the inner edge of the curving stairway, ensuring
that people don't accidentally fall off. Opposite the stairway, a massive
carving of a ferocious bear leaps out of the southern wall. The top of the
ominous stairway ends at a semi-circular landing which lies before a bleak
wall of charred black stone and a sturdy door made of solid oak.

stone landing. A tattered black velvet carpet covers parts of the landing,
but it does next to nothing to dispel the unnatural chill that permeates
the ancient keep. The landing continues to the west, while a wide walkway
of charred stone leads to the south. A series of arrow slits perforate the
outer wall, and a narrow passage lies beyond the archway to the north.

have been acquired over the centuries. Some of the shields are adorned with
modern designs, but most of them are decorated with old devices that have
not been used in a long time. An assortment of broken weapons lie among the
charred tapestries lying on the floor in haphazard piles near the eastern
wall. The enormous ceiling swoops up until it is lost in darkness.

    It is quite claustrophobic in here, beneath the scorched stone archway
of the ancient gatehouse. The scratched and bloody stones are designed to
force enemy soldiers to gather closer together so that they can be killed
more efficiently. A door in the eastern wall looks like it leads to a small
guard house, while the gate to the west leads into some ruined stables. The
heavy iron doors to the ancient keep loom to the north, relatively unharmed
despite the intensity of the fires that consumed the castle long ago.

covered with a filthy layer of refuse and litter. The sprawling encampment

emblazoned with the symbol of the Blue Dragonarmy. Each individual tent has
a small bedroll inside but otherwise looks pretty uncomfortable. The bored
soldiers must have been here for a long time since the scorched stones are
covered with a filthy layer of refuse and litter. The sprawling encampment
continues to the south and east from here, while an enormous blue tent lies
just to the north, separated from the tents of common soldiers.

are not the result of a standard fire, but instead a strange chemical,
possibly the product of the Deep Mine pyromancer's guild. This hall seems
well travelled by the feet of adventurers, as scuff marks and divets mar
the once perfectly smooth wooden floor. While it appears that janitors

through the dense vallenwood forest. High overhead, the limbs mesh to form
a thick green canopy. The avenue continues north, while you see and hear
Solace Square to the south. A small clearing opens to the west. Looking
east, you see a large vallenwood that has a building nestled among its
strong limbs. A small stairway spirals down around the trunk, ending at the
edge of the road. A small sign is posted next to the stairway.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the buildings.

    Southern Avenue is a road cut among the huge vallenwoods. It twists and

foliage above. From high in a vallenwood above you, you hear sounds of
partying and singing. Looking up to investigate, you notice a tavern has
been built into the huge limbs of the vallenwood. Unfortunately, there is
no way up to the bar from here. The avenue also leads north and south into

vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the

    This narrow road runs right up against the western foothills of the
Eastland mountain range. It continues to the north and to the west where it
can be seen cutting a line through the unmolested grass of the Abanasinia
plains. A smaller path branches off the road and leads east here, deeper
into the grassy plains. A short distance to the north west a few strands of
black smoke can be seen rising from the base of the Kharolis mountains.

    A narrow road runs from the north to the south here, paralleling the
Eastwall mountains that rise from the plains a short ways to the east. The
plains also extend to the west where they run into an arm of the Kharolis
mountains. Judging from the height of the grass, you can only assume that
the land sandwiched between these two ranges must be very fertile.

    Waves from the Newsea crash onto the shoreline, sending spray of salty
water into the air. Strong gusts from the north whip at your clothes and
kick sand and water droplets into your face. From the eastern horizon to
the western horizon, all that can be seen are the waters of the Newsea.
Directly across the waters to the north you can barely make out a land mass
and a city, it must be Port o'Call. The sand along the shore becomes more
sparse to the south and a road leads away from the shoreline.

Somewhere located within is the City of Pashin, a hodgepodge city with both

    This narrow road winds a treacherous path through these grim foothills.
The trail is rocky and somewhat unstable, through clumps of pine trees and
the occasional hardwood, though other than that the terrain is rather
monotonous. The land is hilly, though not altogether rugged, as most of the
hillsides that comprise the area are grassy or covered with small rocks.
The jagged, violent peaks of the Khalkist Mountains sneer at you high
above to the north.

    The narrow road twists and winds around the larger foothills here.
These hills are the southern extent of the mightly Khalkist Mountains which
loom over you to the north. The peaks are such a bleak, dark grey, they
almost look charred against the sky. To the south the rocky road flattens
somewhat into more hilly foothills while those to the north only become
more treacherous and rocky. In the distance you can see faint signs of
smoke barely rising above the foothills far to the southwest.

summer solstice. Although the conditions can be harsh, you can see several
clumps of hardwoods providing some shade for travellers. Far east beyond

against a wall of a house. No doubt it has seen much service. The wooden
platform is blood stained and emits the smell of salt-water, used as a poor
cleaning fluid to remove the worst of the grime. Death row continues to the

    The air here is deathly silent, even the rats tread lightly in this
dismal cell block. North of here is the jail's main corridor, while to the
east and west are two gloomy cells. Nailed into the grey stone of the
southern wall is a list of some sort, which seems to be the only feature of

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

[36mThe End of a Tunnel[0;37m
    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the
tunnel continues into darkness.

    The tunnel takes an abrupt turn here, leading into darkness both south
and west. A melodic trickling sound echoes through the cavernous walls, its
source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

[36mIntersecting Halls[0;37m
    Dark wooden panels make up the walls of the two hallways that converge
here, and dirt trails the floor following them both. Down the western
hallway you can hardly miss a large gate that stands directly at the end of
it, while the southern hallway stops at a flight of stairs that lead up to
a higher floor. The only thing of interest here appears to be a wooden door
leading east.

[36mThe End of a Hall[0;37m
    Open doorways lead north and south from here, and a dark wood paneled
hallway runs straight to the east. Taking up a majority of the western wall
is a gate of light brown stone, set into a smooth archway that stands as
tall as the ceiling. Directly south looks to be an office of sorts, north
the entry to another section of the building, and far down the hall to the
east is a wooden door. From here you can travel in any direction, though
the safest path is anyone's guess.

[36mBefore a Gate[0;37m
    Standing at this end of the tunnel is a gateway that has been smoothly
carved out of the surrounding rock. A small guard post has also been set up
here to keep out unwanted visitors who happen to stumble across the tunnel,
though security seems a bit lax. White-blue light given off by a curious
luminescent moss keeps the tunnel fairly lit, though the ever present taste
of damp air is especially choking here. Moisture gathered on the dirty
floor has lain way to dozens of muddy puddles, making the floor quite
slippery and navigation a filthy endeavor.

    The tunnel here is not naturally lit, but a dim blue light emanating
from the east reflects like tiny stars off of the moist walls, although it
is not enough to see in the darkness. The coarse walls meet in a corner to
the southwest, and draw the tunnel on to the north and east.

[36mA Turn in the Tunnel[0;37m
    The tunnel takes an abrupt turn here, leading into darkness both south
and west. A melodic trickling sound echoes through the cavernous walls, its
source scattered in all directions and difficult to pinpoint. Upon closer
inspection of the walls the cause of the noise becomes obvious, thin cracks
in the rock collect moisture from the musty air into small veins of water.
Flowing all the way to the dirty floor, the water eventually pools into a
miniature sea of mud around your feet.

    The hewn rock walls glisten with moisture, and occasionally a drip of
water collects at a jagged edge and falls to the floor. Soft pattering
echoes fill the tunnel, though the pleasantness of it is nulled by the
thick and dank air. Rising up to the ceiling here is a crude wooden ladder
fastened with leather straps, propped against the edge of a small hole. The
rough walls close in around you in all directions save east, where the
tunnel continues into darkness.

    Balifor's more vicious criminals are kept in these underground cells,
cut off from society and sunlight. The walls are stained with foulness and
the floor is worn in a line, likely from the only thing a prisoner has to
pass the time here: pace. In a back corner of the cell a crude mattress is
strewn out on the floor without a bed frame to rest upon, and across from
it sits a bucket in which prisoners relieve themselves. Being underground,
the air here is un-circulated and musty, mold grows freely on the walls and
the iron cell bars are textured with rust.

    The corridor stretches north and south. Heavily barred cells run along
the opposite walls. Every odd interval you come across a torch stuck in the
stone, only to find it long ago burnt out. You wonder if it is purposefully
kept dark down here to further depress the prisoners. The groans and foul
curses of the rowdy prisoners fill your ears. It seems only a lucky few
will ever see the light of day again.

    The front area of the Balifor jail is a large square room. A bare
concrete floor heavily scuffed by the passage of countless thieves and
criminals lies beneath your feet. The walls are thick and dull yellow with
exposed wooden beams racing up to the rafters above. Hanging from the walls
are large bulletin boards pinned with ragged wanted posters and bounties.
Ahead of you lies a wooden desk with a hallway off to the right. To the
north is a door.

cramped with wooden bunks hugging the bare stone wall to the east. Some
metal lockers on the north wall are used to stow away their gear.

[36mThe Second Floor[0;37m
    A hallway extends to the north from the stairway landing. The wooden
floorboards creak as you make your way. Several doors leading to the
guard's quarters flank you on both sides. Ahead to the north lies a door
with a sign of rank above the frame.

[36mA Corridor[0;37m
    The corridor extends to the east, deeper into the Balifor jail. Back
west lies the front area where new prisoners are registered before being
thrown in their cells. Several torches hang from the opposite walls,
lighting your way. In the south wall a flight of stairs ascends to the
second floor.

[36mA Corridor[0;37m
    The corridor leads to the east and west. Flickering torches set into
the stone walls illuminate the area. The clomp of boot shod feet bound
through the corridor as jail guards pass by. Two heavily reinforced oaken
doors lie just to the east. Most likely they lead down to the prison cells.
