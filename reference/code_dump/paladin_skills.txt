Paladin Skills

Weapons - l.blades(95), s.blades(90), two-handed(90), piercers(90), polearms(95), blud(90), misc(80)

Lay(90) - The amount healed is not affected by faith but the statuses that can be removed are, can remove disease, poison, bleeding, curse, blindness, weaken, and energy drain

Rescue(90) - No stat modifiers

Bandage(50) - No stat modifiers

Strike(90) - Striking with an offhand halves your skill, missing your strike worsens your AC by about 30, if you use an offhand or strike while blind you have a chance to fumble, the fumble chance is a Dex check modified by your faith and the weight of the weapon, fumbling a weapon lowers your crit_resist, legendary strike negates all the negative effects and adds a 50% chance to increase you dam_factor by 3 on a successful strike, strike damage is about 90% of a normal weapon attack and legendary adds 25% more damage

Shield Block(80) - Higher Dex and Str reduce more damage, shields take 1 damage for every block
  Chance to block is affected by: big hits (dam > 50) lower your skill by 10, sitting halves your skill, light shields (<20) increase your skill while heavy shields (>30) decrease your skill
  Damage reduction is a percentage and is affected by: your skill (base reduction = 5 + (skill / 10)), your faith (adds 1-20), a successful contested Dex check adds 1/3 of your Dex, a successful contested Str check adds 1/3 of your Str, shield quality (from -5 for Poor to +10 for Superior), there is a small chance to block 100% of an attack if you win 2 contested stat checks
  Retaliation damage = (faith / 100) + (level / 5) + (weight / 5), 25% of retaliations are headshots that interrupt spells, attacks, parry, and dodge while another 25% of retaliations bash, retaliation damage can be absorbed by enemy armor

March(90) - No stat modifiers

Reckoning(90) - No stat modifiers, increases the paladin's damage for a short time, duration = skill / 15 + 1, damroll = 1-3 + skill / 20
-
Turn(70) - Affected by Cha, winning a contested Cha ability check helps your turn result, the formula is complicated but if you try to turn an enemy your level and you are a lawful cleric who wins the contested Cha check you still only succeed about 50% of them time, paladins only about 25% of the time, much easier to turn enemies lower level than you

Rally(80) - Higher Cha can improve the effects but it is unlikely, with perfect faith you can affect 6 party members, with max skill and perfect faith your success chance is: 100 for goodies, 90 for neutrals, and 85 for evils, duration = skill / 10 rounds, legendary doubles the duration and tries to apply 3 effects instead of 1, legendary also adds -10 limit_dam to the paladin

-
Avenging Faith(90) - Abilitiy check differs depending on which area you target, the base effect is determined by your faith, high faith and legendary will guarantee you get the best effect because legendary adds 200 faith for this purpose, if you have max skill and (faith > 750) you also get the bonus effect, legendary adds +5 to your ability check and (2d30 + 10d3) damage
