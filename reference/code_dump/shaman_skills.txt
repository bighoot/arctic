GET_GUILD( spirit )
right off the bat there is a Cha check, your Cha has to be equal or greater than a random number from 1-70
so even with a 24 Cha you will only pass that 1/3 of the time
if ( number( 1, 70 ) > GET_CHA( ch ) ) return FALSE;
if you pass that then there is another check highly dependent on the level of the spirit
chance = 9 * GET_LEVEL( spirit ) / 10;
