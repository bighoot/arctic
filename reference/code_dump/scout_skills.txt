Scout Skills

Weapons - axes(95), blud(90), l.blades(85), misc(95), piercers(85), s.blades(85)

Bandage(80) - No stat modifiers

Hide(80) - No stat modifiers, the more people who pass through the room the higher your learn chance becomes, it takes 14 people to hit 50% learn chance

Shoot(90) - Affected by bow stats, arrow stats, Int, and Dex
  Accuracy - Min_chance = (bow_accuracy + arrow_accuracy + hitroll + Int + (skill / 5), Max_chance = (skill / 2) + 50, base_chance = (random number between min and max) + level, if the target is a Giant add half your level again
  Power - Base_dam = 2d(((bow_power + arrow_power) / 2) + 3 + (skill / 15) + damroll), against NPCs the damage is lessened by class (-7 for warriors, for example), if the target is a giant add (level / 4) to the damage, there is a 1% chance that armor checks and limit_damage are skipped for full damage
  Speed - Base_speed = (5 * Dex) + (skill / 5) + ((bow_speed + arrow_speed) * 2) + level, Haste adds +20 to base_speed, final_speed = (300 - base_speed) / 10, the lower the better with 4 being the minimum you can reach, it represents the number of 1/4 second pulses to lag the shooter, if you can get down to a final_speed of 4 or less that means you can shoot 4 times per turn

Instinct(90) - No stat modifiers (see instinct breakdown)

Hunt(90) - No stat modifiers

Sneak(80) - No stat modifiers, the farther you travel the higher your learn chance becomes, backtracking does not help, it takes 25 rooms to hit 50% learn chance
-
Target(90) - Half of your Dex is added to the calculation, modified skill = ((skill + dex) / 2) + (45 - enemy dex or level whichever is greater), failure_mod = skill + 1d100, failure mod is checked to see if you fall or switch to the wrong target, failure < 41 attacks the wrong target, 41-70 falls out of combat

Camp(90) - No stat modifiers, campfires always increases move regen by (skill / 3) + 10, if skill > 33 it also gives hps regen of (skill / 3) + 5, if skill > 66 then it gives mem_factor of (skill / 5)

Scout(90) - Affected by Dex/Int/Wis, Scout requires a Dex check, Scout scan requires a Dex and Int check, Scout long requires all three checks - Dex/Int/Wis

Fence(90) - Affected by Dex and Str like Parry, 25% less successful than Parry, the fencing roll is 1d105 instead of the usual 1d100, if fencing while sitting subrtract 50 from your skill, if either party is blind add/subtract 30 from your skill, each successive fencing attempt gets harder

Fade(75) - No stat modifiers, makes sneak and hide checks

Rescue(80) - No stat modifiers
-
Riposte(90) - Modified by weapon skill, combined_skill = riposte_skill + weapon_skill, a value called power is calculated randomly from 1-4 with 4 being the hardest to get, if power > 1 then weapon damage is doubled, each weapon type has a slightly different effect for each of the 3 types of ripostes: Thrust, Slash, and Bludgeon, most of these special effects need a power of 3 or more to activate
  Axes - Thrust adds 5 damage and applies bash_mod, Slash adds 5 damage and applies silence, Bludgeon adds 0 damage and applies negative damage_factor
  Bludgeons - Thrust adds 0 damage and worsens the victim's armor, Slash adds 5 damage and lowers the victim's strength (can also sit them), Bludgeon adds 5 damage and applies negative hitroll
  L.Blades - Thrust adds 0 damage and applies negative regen_factor and damage_factor (can also cause a fumble), Slash adds 5 damage and applies negative health, Bludgeon adds 5 damage and increases your critical score (can also disorient victim)
  Misc - Thrust adds 5 damage and worsens their spell_save (can also worsen para_save), Slash adds 0 damage and applies fumble_chance, Bludgeon adds 5 damage and applies negative concentration_factor
  Piercers - Thrust adds 5 damage and blinds, Slash adds 0 damage lowers flee_chance, Bludgeon adds 5 damage and sits the target
  S.Blades - Thrust adds 0 damage and limit_damage factor (can also paralyze), Slash adds 5 damage and applies negative Str (can also apply negative Dex), Bludgeon adds 0 damage and casts weariness on the victim (can also lower flee_chance
